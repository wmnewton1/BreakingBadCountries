 1
 00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,274
 In the little village where I was born,
 life moved at a slower pace...
 
 2
 00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,115
 ...yet felt all the richer for it.
 
 3
 00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,037
 There, my two uncles were known far
 and wide for their delicious cooking.
 
 4
 00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,156
 They seasoned their zesty chicken...
 
 5
 00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,630
 ...using only the freshest herbs
 and spices.
 
 6
 00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,951
 People called them
 Los Pollos Hermanos...
 
 7
 00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,678
 ..."The Chicken Brothers."
 
 8
 00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,479
 Today, we carry on their tradition...
 
 9
 00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,598
 ...in a manner that would make
 my uncles proud.
 
 10
 00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,389
 The finest ingredients are brought
 together with loving care...
 
 11
 00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,836
 ...then slow-cook ed to perfection.
 
 12
 00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,120
 Yes, the old ways are still best
 at Los Pollos Hermanos.
 
 13
 00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,513
 But don't tak e my word for it.
 One taste and you'll know.
 
 14
 00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,390
 Two-oh-one-point-six.
 
 15
 00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,596
 Jesus, seriously.
 
 16
 00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,955
 Better over than under.
 
 17
 00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,191
 Over by a pound and a half.
 
 18
 00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,794
 I thought you were all, like, precise.
 
 19
 00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,198
 Whatever.
 We'll just save it out till next week.
 
 20
 00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,157
 We ship it as is.
 
 21
 00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,233
 What, are we running a charity?
 Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.
 
 22
 00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,789
 Leave it. One batch, one ship.
 
 23
 00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,474
 Stop complicating things.
 
 24
 00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,350
 Why are you purposely giving him
 free meth?
 
 25
 00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,717
 These bitches are bleeding us
 enough already.
 
 26
 00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,269
 You are paid extraordinarily well.
 
 27
 00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,194
 - Why can't you just appreciate that?
 - Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.
 
 28
 00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,590
 - Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
 - Yeah.
 
 29
 00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,149
 And I don't gotta be a mathematician
 to figure out...
 
 30
 00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,276
 ...that this deal you made is bullshit.
 
 31
 00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,829
 - We both earn...
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
 
 32
 00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,037
 A million and a half each.
 
 33
 00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,033
 What's he getting, huh?
 
 34
 00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,033
 Say he's wholesaling at
 40 large a pound.
 
 35
 00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,758
 That's probably high.
 
 36
 00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,276
 High. What, for our stuff?
 That's what I was getting.
 
 37
 00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,829
 All right, look,
 say he's getting 40 a pound.
 
 38
 00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,958
 All right, 200 pounds a week
 for three months.
 
 39
 00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,829
 And, like, what happens at the... end
 of the three months? Look, whatever.
 
 40
 00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,834
 Two hundred pounds a week
 for three months. That's 2400 pounds.
 
 41
 00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,956
 Twenty-four hundred
 times 40,000 is...
 
 42
 00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,032
 And I swear to God,
 I double-checked this like 10 times.
 
 43
 00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,475
 Ninety-six million dollars.
 
 44
 00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,792
 Ninety-six million dollars.
 
 45
 00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,793
 All right? Ninety-six million.
 
 46
 00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,679
 Ninety-six to our three.
 
 47
 00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,592
 That is messed up, yo.
 
 48
 00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,671
 That is so messed up.
 
 49
 00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,274
 - Fairness-wise, I can't even...
 - Jesse.
 
 50
 00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,836
 You are now a millionaire
 and you're complaining?
 
 51
 00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,875
 What world do you live in?
 
 52
 00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,716
 One where the dudes who are actually
 doing all the work ain't getting fisted.
 
 53
 00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,757
 What is going on with you lately?
 
 54
 00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,911
 What's happened to you?
 
 55
 00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,555
 Hang on, can't we just...?
 
 56
 00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,594
 Hey, we gotta hash this out.
 
 57
 00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,799
 Hey, what's more important
 than money?
 
 58
 00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,989
 These things they laughingly
 call pillows...
 
 59
 00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,958
 ...I would not give them
 to prison inmates.
 
 60
 00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,997
 You want me to go ask for another?
 
 61
 00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,118
 No, just remind me to bring his
 from home.
 
 62
 00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,629
 They're not moving his legs enough.
 
 63
 00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,915
 Hey, everybody.
 
 64
 00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,158
 Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?
 
 65
 00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,319
 Yeah.
 
 66
 00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,434
 His colour looks good.
 
 67
 00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,470
 Gomey, is that you?
 
 68
 00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,517
 Buddy, yeah, it's me.
 
 69
 00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,355
 That's you, Gomey?
 
 70
 00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,273
 Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.
 
 71
 00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,829
 Come here. Closer.
 
 72
 00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,789
 - What is it?
 - Closer.
 
 73
 00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,674
 Asshole.
 
 74
 00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,879
 Man, he got you good.
 
 75
 00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,031
 Yeah, yeah.
 
 76
 00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,909
 I'm glad to see you still have
 your twisted sense of humour.
 
 77
 00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,078
 God.
 
 78
 00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,868
 Hey, check this out.
 
 79
 00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,109
 I got something
 that'll make you feel better.
 
 80
 00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,432
 Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
 of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.
 
 81
 00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
 Then all of a sudden, boom,
 it's popping up everywhere.
 
 82
 00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,952
 Look at the new locations.
 Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.
 
 83
 00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,678
 Even right here in town.
 
 84
 00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,071
 A teener here and there, you know,
 strictly street-level amounts.
 
 85
 00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,798
 Man, it's crazy.
 
 86
 00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,678
 How exactly is that supposed
 to make me feel better?
 
 87
 00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,713
 Because you were right.
 
 88
 00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,950
 You're the only one that
 saw this coming.
 
 89
 00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,473
 Well, three cheers for me.
 
 90
 00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,194
 This thing doesn't do a damn thing.
 
 91
 00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,635
 Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.
 
 92
 00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,279
 It's been an hour, right?
 
 93
 00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,711
 I'm hurting here.
 I could use some meds.
 
 94
 00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,436
 I'll go find somebody.
 
 95
 00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,239
 Hey, no more shop talk.
 
 96
 00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,958
 Sorry.
 
 97
 00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,150
 I didn't see it coming.
 
 98
 00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,278
 What? Damn right, you did.
 
 99
 00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,556
 No, I didn't see shit.
 
 100
 00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,954
 Day late and dollar short, as usual.
 
 101
 00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,072
 The only reason I'm even breathing...
 
 102
 00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,830
 ...is I got a warning call.
 
 103
 00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
 A warning call? What do you mean?
 
 104
 00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,472
 One minute
 before they attacked me...
 
 105
 00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,679
 ...somebody called my cell
 and told me to expect it.
 
 106
 00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,037
 A voice scrambler.
 Could have been anybody.
 
 107
 00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,756
 Marie's got my phone somewhere,
 if you want to run the incoming.
 
 108
 00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,750
 Not that you're gonna learn anything
 worth knowing.
 
 109
 00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,275
 I don't get it. Cartel hit?
 
 110
 00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,035
 - Who would have called to warn you?
 - I don't know.
 
 111
 00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,710
 Oh, Jesus.
 
 112
 00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,958
 - Come on already.
 - Okay.
 
 113
 00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,872
 Skyler, I had nothing to do...
 
 114
 00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,910
 Are we safe?
 
 115
 00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,233
 Yes.
 
 116
 00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,151
 Are you safe?
 
 117
 00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,951
 Absolutely.
 
 118
 00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,078
 Jesse?
 
 119
 00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,318
 Jesse?
 
 120
 00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,918
 What about you?
 
 121
 00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,470
 Face looks better.
 
 122
 00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,754
 How's it all going?
 Anything you wanna tell us about?
 
 123
 00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,197
 What, like my interesting life?
 
 124
 00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,637
 One day pretty much bleeds
 into the next.
 
 125
 00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,989
 Been working a lot.
 
 126
 00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,235
 - Got a job.
 - Job is good.
 
 127
 00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,109
 It's in a Laundromat.
 It's totally corporate.
 
 128
 00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,429
 Corporate Laundromat.
 
 129
 00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,876
 It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
 My boss is a dick.
 
 130
 00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,474
 The owner, super dick.
 
 131
 00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,150
 I'm not worthy to meet him,
 but everybody's scared of the dude.
 
 132
 00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,709
 The place is full
 of dead-eyed douche bags...
 
 133
 00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,919
 ...the hours suck and nobody knows
 what's going on, so...
 
 134
 00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,719
 Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.
 
 135
 00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,552
 Yeah.
 
 136
 00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,028
 Totally Kafkaesque.
 
 137
 00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,678
 Majorly.
 
 138
 00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,635
 From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.
 
 139
 00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,870
 Very nice.
 
 140
 00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,838
 You've got all these nice tulips
 and baby's breath.
 
 141
 00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,276
 Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
 That looks like chrysanthemum.
 
 142
 00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,237
 - Yeah.
 - Look at these, Hank.
 
 143
 00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,197
 - Aren't they beautiful?
 - Beautiful.
 
 144
 00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,433
 Wow, look at the size of this basket.
 It's got so many goodies in it.
 
 145
 00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,036
 Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
 and cheese sticks...
 
 146
 00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,668
 ...and some fancy designer olives.
 
 147
 00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,310
 You had me at cheese sticks. You're
 gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.
 
 148
 00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,914
 "Get well and best wishes
 from Ted Beneke...
 
 149
 00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,594
 ...and all the folks
 at Beneke Fabricators."
 
 150
 00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,752
 Wow, he gives you all this time off
 and now this.
 
 151
 00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,673
 - Get me a job there.
 - I know. He's great.
 
 152
 00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,957
 Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
 here from Kleinman.
 
 153
 00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,395
 They're gonna have to get
 on the stick.
 
 154
 00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,433
 - How's everybody doing today?
 - Good. We're good.
 
 155
 00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
 - How are you?
 - I'm very good.
 
 156
 00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,149
 Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
 a quick peripheral response, all right?
 
 157
 00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,118
 - See where we're at.
 - Moment of truth?
 
 158
 00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,157
 Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.
 
 159
 00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,437
 All right, let's just take a look here.
 
 160
 00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,998
 All right.
 
 161
 00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,398
 All right, now I want you to tell me
 if you can feel this.
 
 162
 00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,317
 All right.
 
 163
 00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,436
 How about this?
 
 164
 00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,872
 Okay.
 
 165
 00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,875
 How about now?
 
 166
 00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,751
 Do that one again, would you?
 
 167
 00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,949
 Right there?
 
 168
 00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,870
 - Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
 - Okay, on a scale of one to ten...
 
 169
 00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,476
 ...ten being your normal level of feeling
 and one being no feeling at all.
 
 170
 00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,073
 Oh, I don't know.
 
 171
 00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,551
 - Four?
 - Okay, four. Okay.
 
 172
 00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,032
 And how about there?
 
 173
 00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,033
 Yeah. A six.
 
 174
 00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,638
 Okay, good. And here.
 
 175
 00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,598
 Yeah, still there. A little less.
 
 176
 00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,993
 - A three.
 - Okay.
 
 177
 00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,310
 All right, good.
 
 178
 00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,670
 Thank you very much, Hank.
 Did good.
 
 179
 00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,276
 So this is good news, right?
 
 180
 00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,793
 Oh, yeah, definitely.
 
 181
 00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,279
 Gosh.
 
 182
 00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,830
 It looks like some nerve function
 is returning.
 
 183
 00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,831
 Oh, thank God.
 
 184
 00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,515
 All right, so when do we get him
 walking again?
 
 185
 00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,712
 Marie, it's important
 that we manage our expectations.
 
 186
 00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,315
 We're talking about months
 of very hard work.
 
 187
 00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,438
 And even then,
 the odds, they're not great.
 
 188
 00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,556
 But you can't know for sure.
 
 189
 00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,314
 - No.
 - When does he start physical therapy?
 
 190
 00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,550
 We've sent the paperwork
 to your insurance.
 
 191
 00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,554
 It's high-priority. We should have
 pre-authorisation in the next few days.
 
 192
 00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,312
 Certainly by early next week.
 
 193
 00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,833
 Next week?
 
 194
 00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,350
 No, that's not gonna do it.
 
 195
 00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,953
 I've looked into this.
 
 196
 00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,715
 And the sooner physical therapy
 begins, the better his chances are.
 
 197
 00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,077
 He needs daily sessions.
 Isn't that right?
 
 198
 00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,229
 - Well...
 - Actually...
 
 199
 00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,437
 ...your plan's treatment programme
 covers four sessions a week.
 
 200
 00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,388
 Actually, she asked the doctor.
 
 201
 00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,678
 Plan-wise, four treatments a week
 is fairly typical.
 
 202
 00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,798
 And the therapists in your network
 are mostly fine.
 
 203
 00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,633
 Mostly fine. Okay, well,
 there's a ringing endorsement.
 
 204
 00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,192
 Look, if Hank had more physical
 therapy with better therapists...
 
 205
 00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,954
 ...wouldn't it be more likely
 he would walk?
 
 206
 00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,832
 It's very hard to say, Marie.
 
 207
 00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,118
 Is the health plan's way
 medically justifiable? Sure.
 
 208
 00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,475
 Is it absolutely optimal?
 
 209
 00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,473
 You know, screw it.
 
 210
 00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,993
 I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
 They can reimburse me.
 
 211
 00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,232
 Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
 Really, I do.
 
 212
 00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,473
 But my best advice is stay
 in the network. Don't go out of pocket.
 
 213
 00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,551
 Physical therapy is just
 the beginning.
 
 214
 00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,235
 We're talking nursing care,
 modifications to your home...
 
 215
 00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,789
 ...occupational therapy,
 medical equipment.
 
 216
 00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,157
 It could run into the hundreds
 of thousands of dollars.
 
 217
 00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,833
 So what?
 
 218
 00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,230
 We're just supposed to compromise
 on his care?
 
 219
 00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,551
 Well, if you don't follow
 the insurance company's procedures...
 
 220
 00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,233
 ...they may never pay you back.
 
 221
 00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,439
 I've seen patients and their families
 go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.
 
 222
 00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,593
 Who is the best physical therapist
 that you know?
 
 223
 00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,831
 I can give you some names.
 
 224
 00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,070
 But they're not likely to be
 on your plan.
 
 225
 00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,468
 To hell with the plan.
 
 226
 00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,550
 There he is. Finally.
 I went ahead and started without you.
 
 227
 00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,632
 Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
 He's in for the full treatment.
 
 228
 00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,552
 Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.
 
 229
 00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,188
 - Exfoliate.
 - Maybe later.
 
 230
 00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,430
 Where's the maestro,
 out parking the minivan?
 
 231
 00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,953
 Do I look like his shadow?
 
 232
 00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,714
 Who cares where he's at?
 What am I doing here?
 
 233
 00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,674
 Well, I was gonna have you two
 flip a coin.
 
 234
 00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,914
 But since the genius can't be bothered,
 today's your lucky day.
 
 235
 00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,435
 Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.
 
 236
 00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,999
 What?
 
 237
 00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,238
 - This?
 - Yeah.
 
 238
 00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,551
 You are now the owner
 of this fine... establishment.
 
 239
 00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,278
 - For free?
 - Free?
 
 240
 00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,718
 Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
 No, not free.
 
 241
 00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,917
 Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
 highly profitable...
 
 242
 00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,354
 At least potentially.
 
 243
 00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,910
 - Iocal institution looked upon with
 favour by the Chamber of Commerce...
 
 244
 00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,073
 ...Better Business Bureau.
 At $312,000, it's a steal.
 
 245
 00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,515
 Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?
 
 246
 00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,190
 Don't you get it? On the outside,
 it's a nail salon, right?
 
 247
 00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,593
 On the inside, it's the best money
 laundry a growing boy could ask for.
 
 248
 00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,909
 Wait, wait, wait. Hey.
 
 249
 00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,799
 Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
 Good job. Come back here.
 
 250
 00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,270
 Sit. Come on, come on.
 
 251
 00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,915
 Humour me here for a second.
 
 252
 00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,550
 Now, you know you need to launder
 your money, right?
 
 253
 00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,430
 Do you understand the basics of it,
 placement, layering, integration?
 
 254
 00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,433
 I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
 so just forget it.
 
 255
 00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,192
 Don't you want to stay out of jail?
 
 256
 00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,715
 I mean, you wanna keep your money
 and your freedom.
 
 257
 00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,348
 Because I got three little letters
 for you: IRS.
 
 258
 00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,954
 If they can get Capone,
 they can get you.
 
 259
 00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,193
 Hey, look. Here's you, right?
 Pink, Pinkman. Get it?
 
 260
 00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,032
 Okay, here's your cash.
 
 261
 00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,033
 You're out on the town.
 Yeah, you're partying hearty.
 
 262
 00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,829
 You're knocking boots
 with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?
 
 263
 00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,560
 It's the tax man.
 And he's looking at you.
 
 264
 00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,073
 Now, what does he see?
 
 265
 00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,800
 He sees a young fellow
 with a big fancy house...
 
 266
 00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,520
 ...unlimited cash supply and no job.
 
 267
 00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,797
 Now, what is the conclusion
 the tax man makes?
 
 268
 00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,999
 - I'm a drug dealer.
 - Wrong.
 
 269
 00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,436
 Million times worse.
 You're a tax cheat.
 
 270
 00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,830
 What do they do?
 They take... every penny...
 
 271
 00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,072
 ...and you go in the can
 for felony tax evasion.
 
 272
 00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,754
 What was your mistake?
 
 273
 00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,229
 You didn't launder your money.
 
 274
 00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,870
 Now, you give me your money, okay?
 That's called placement.
 
 275
 00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,793
 Hand me that little thing... Bin.
 
 276
 00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,992
 This is the nail salon, right?
 
 277
 00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,871
 I take your dirty money and I slip it
 into the salon's nice clean cash flow.
 
 278
 00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,712
 That's called layering.
 
 279
 00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,518
 Final step, integration.
 
 280
 00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,036
 The revenues from the salon
 go to the owner. That's you.
 
 281
 00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,112
 Your filthy drug money
 has been transformed...
 
 282
 00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
 ...into nice, clean, taxable income...
 
 283
 00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,913
 ...brought to you by a savvy investment
 in a thriving business.
 
 284
 00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,233
 So you want me to buy this place
 so I can pay taxes.
 
 285
 00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,753
 I'm a criminal, yo.
 
 286
 00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,234
 Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
 and not become, say, a convict...
 
 287
 00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,914
 ...maybe you should grow up
 and listen to your lawyer.
 
 288
 00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,072
 Right, so you can get your 5 percent.
 
 289
 00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,196
 No, that's 17 percent.
 
 290
 00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,432
 I heard you say 5.
 You said it right in front of me.
 
 291
 00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,797
 Yeah, that was for your partner.
 It's privileges of seniority and all.
 
 292
 00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,509
 But for you, it's the usual,
 17 percent and that's a bargain.
 
 293
 00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,352
 Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...
 
 294
 00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,318
 Come on, I'm talking to you about
 your future here. Listen to reason.
 
 295
 00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,673
 How is your brother-in-law?
 
 296
 00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,632
 He'll live.
 
 297
 00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,916
 Good. I'm glad.
 
 298
 00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,998
 Walter, you seem troubled.
 
 299
 00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,037
 How can I help you?
 
 300
 00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,192
 I asked to see you in order
 to clear the air.
 
 301
 00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,597
 There are some issues that could cause
 a misunderstanding between us...
 
 302
 00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,711
 ...and I think it's in our best interests
 to just lay the cards on the table.
 
 303
 00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,074
 That's the best way to do business.
 
 304
 00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,235
 My brother-in-law,
 moments before he was attacked...
 
 305
 00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,834
 ...someone called to warn him.
 
 306
 00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,273
 I believe that same person
 was protecting me.
 
 307
 00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,199
 Those two men, the assassins...
 
 308
 00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,472
 ...I believe I was their prime target.
 
 309
 00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,999
 But that somehow, they were steered
 away from me to my brother-in-law.
 
 310
 00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,030
 Because of this intervention...
 
 311
 00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
 ...I am alive.
 
 312
 00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,596
 And yet I think that this person...
 
 313
 00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,992
 ...was playing a much deeper game.
 
 314
 00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,516
 He made that phone call
 because he wanted a shootout...
 
 315
 00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,513
 ...not a silent assassination.
 
 316
 00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,351
 In one stroke,
 he bloodied both sides...
 
 317
 00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,708
 ...set the American and Mexican
 governments against the cartel...
 
 318
 00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,078
 ...and cut off the supply
 of methamphetamine to the Southwest.
 
 319
 00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,149
 If this man had his own source
 of product on this side of the border...
 
 320
 00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,432
 ...he would have the market
 to himself.
 
 321
 00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,348
 The rewards would be... enormous.
 
 322
 00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,354
 We're both adults.
 
 323
 00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,550
 I can't pretend I don't know
 that person is you.
 
 324
 00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,039
 I want there to be no confusion.
 
 325
 00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,239
 I know I owe you my life.
 
 326
 00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,956
 And more than that...
 
 327
 00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
 ...I respect the strategy.
 
 328
 00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,596
 In your position...
 
 329
 00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,074
 ...I would have done the same.
 
 330
 00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,836
 One issue which troubles me...
 
 331
 00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,074
 ...I don't know what happens
 when our three-month contract ends.
 
 332
 00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,835
 What would you like to happen?
 
 333
 00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,714
 You know why I do this.
 
 334
 00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,472
 I want security for my family.
 
 335
 00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,914
 Then you have it.
 
 336
 00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,596
 Three million for three months.
 That was our agreement.
 
 337
 00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,753
 Extended annually, 12 million a year.
 
 338
 00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,156
 Call it 15.
 
 339
 00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,117
 Open-ended.
 
 340
 00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,197
 Would that be agreeable?
 
 341
 00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,359
 Part of the reason we talk about what
 gets us riled up in our daily lives...
 
 342
 00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,150
 ...is to help each other put a finger
 on what our relapse triggers might be...
 
 343
 00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,031
 ...head off our disease before
 it comes back.
 
 344
 00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,032
 So, anyone?
 
 345
 00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,269
 Free licence to bitch and moan.
 How often do you get that?
 
 346
 00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,797
 Jesse, last time, you seemed down
 about your job at the Laundromat.
 
 347
 00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,839
 Let me ask something. If you had the
 chance to do anything you wanted...
 
 348
 00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,513
 ...what would you do?
 
 349
 00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,394
 Make more green, man. A lot more.
 
 350
 00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,518
 Forget about money.
 Assume you have all you want.
 
 351
 00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,557
 I don't know.
 
 352
 00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,312
 I guess I would make something.
 
 353
 00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,278
 Like what?
 
 354
 00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,628
 I don't know if it even matters...
 
 355
 00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,594
 ...but work with my hands, I guess.
 
 356
 00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,232
 Building things, like carpentry
 or bricklaying or something?
 
 357
 00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,679
 I took this vo-tech class in high school,
 woodworking.
 
 358
 00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,391
 I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
 because it was just a big jerk-off.
 
 359
 00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,076
 But this one time, I had this teacher
 by the name of...
 
 360
 00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,959
 ...Mr. Pike.
 
 361
 00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,957
 I guess he was like a Marine
 or something before he got old.
 
 362
 00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,189
 He was hard of hearing.
 
 363
 00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,548
 My project for his class...
 
 364
 00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,474
 ...was to make this wooden box.
 
 365
 00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,315
 You know, like a small...
 
 366
 00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,919
 Just like a...
 Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.
 
 367
 00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,709
 So I wanted to get the thing done
 as fast as possible.
 
 368
 00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,832
 I figured I could cut classes
 for the rest of the semester...
 
 369
 00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,313
 ...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
 you know, made the thing.
 
 370
 00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,233
 So I finished it in a couple days.
 
 371
 00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,473
 And it looked pretty lame,
 but it worked...
 
 372
 00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,712
 ...you know,
 for putting stuff in or whatnot.
 
 373
 00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,638
 So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...
 
 374
 00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,991
 ...for my grade...
 
 375
 00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,711
 ...he looked at it and said:
 
 376
 00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,232
 "Is that the best you can do?"
 
 377
 00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,230
 At first I thought to myself,
 "Hell yeah, bitch.
 
 378
 00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,918
 Now give me a D and shut up
 so I can go blaze one with my boys."
 
 379
 00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,479
 I don't know.
 Maybe it was the way he said it, but...
 
 380
 00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,870
 It was like he wasn't exactly
 saying it sucked.
 
 381
 00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,194
 He was just asking me honestly,
 "Is that all you got?"
 
 382
 00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,709
 And for some reason,
 I thought to myself:
 
 383
 00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,830
 "Yeah, man, I can do better,"
 so I started from scratch.
 
 384
 00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,878
 I made another, then another.
 
 385
 00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,749
 And by the... end of the semester,
 by like box number five...
 
 386
 00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,634
 ...I had built this thing.
 
 387
 00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,550
 You should have seen it.
 It was insane.
 
 388
 00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,429
 I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
 with inlaid zebrawood.
 
 389
 00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,238
 It was fitted with pegs, no screws.
 
 390
 00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,279
 I sanded it for days
 until it was smooth as glass.
 
 391
 00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,078
 Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
 so it was rich and dark.
 
 392
 00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,793
 It even smelled good.
 
 393
 00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,078
 You know, you put nose in it
 and breathed in, it was...
 
 394
 00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,078
 It was perfect.
 
 395
 00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,391
 What happened to the box?
 
 396
 00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,953
 I gave it to my mom.
 
 397
 00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,718
 Nice.
 
 398
 00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,031
 You know what I'm gonna say,
 don't you?
 
 399
 00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,191
 It's never too late.
 
 400
 00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,439
 They have art co-ops
 that offer classes...
 
 401
 00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,030
 ...adult extension programme
 at the university.
 
 402
 00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,909
 You know,
 I didn't give the box to my mom.
 
 403
 00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,352
 I traded it for an ounce of weed.
 
 404
 00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,310
 He's a hero.
 You don't deny coverage to a hero.
 
 405
 00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,357
 They'll say they're not denying
 coverage.
 
 406
 00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,919
 No, no, I'm agreeing with you.
 
 407
 00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,640
 But I went through all this with Walt.
 
 408
 00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,719
 You'll burn through your savings,
 and then what?
 
 409
 00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,836
 Well, you two managed, right?
 
 410
 00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,115
 You said yourself...
 
 411
 00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,556
 ...that Elliot and Gretchen's money
 didn't cover everything.
 
 412
 00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,829
 - Jesus, I gotta get back.
 - What? No.
 
 413
 00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,319
 No, no, no, you should rest.
 
 414
 00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,358
 Look, why don't you go in
 and take a long bath?
 
 415
 00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,035
 - I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
 - I wanna be there in case he wakes up.
 
 416
 00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,112
 With all they're giving him,
 he'll sleep till morning.
 
 417
 00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,910
 - Hey, Sky.
 - Hey.
 
 418
 00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,670
 - What are you doing here?
 - Thought I'd stop by...
 
 419
 00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,229
 ...to see how you're holding up.
 Is this a bad time?
 
 420
 00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,834
 - Hi.
 - Hi.
 
 421
 00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,197
 Marie, this is Ted, my boss.
 
 422
 00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,634
 Oh, you're Ted.
 
 423
 00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,832
 I've heard so much about you.
 
 424
 00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,592
 Thank you for your gift basket.
 
 425
 00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,274
 - That was really thoughtful.
 - It was nice. Thank you.
 
 426
 00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,237
 - Cheese sticks.
 - Cheese sticks.
 
 427
 00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,834
 You're welcome.
 We care about Skyler so much...
 
 428
 00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,673
 ...that naturally that extends
 to the whole family.
 
 429
 00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,757
 Are you coming in?
 
 430
 00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,308
 Oh, yeah, you should.
 
 431
 00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,472
 - I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
 - Thanks. Okay.
 
 432
 00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,030
 We were having some wine.
 Would you like a glass?
 
 433
 00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,919
 No, no, thanks.
 I'm just on my way home.
 
 434
 00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,149
 I just thought I'd...
 
 435
 00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,791
 You know, I am really beat.
 I think I'm gonna take that bath.
 
 436
 00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,315
 It was nice to meet you, Ted,
 and thank you again.
 
 437
 00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,710
 Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
 Give my best wishes to your husband.
 
 438
 00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,518
 I will.
 
 439
 00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,276
 Thanks for stopping by...
 
 440
 00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,672
 ...but it's actually not the best time
 for a visit, so...
 
 441
 00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,276
 Can we just talk for a minute?
 
 442
 00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,317
 I know you need to be
 with your family...
 
 443
 00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,472
 ...but I haven't heard from you
 in days...
 
 444
 00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,437
 ...and I left messages...
 - I'm so sorry.
 
 445
 00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,160
 You gave me all that time off
 and I really should've...
 
 446
 00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,279
 That's not my point.
 I care about you. That's all.
 
 447
 00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,954
 Ted, I...
 It's just this whole thing with Hank...
 
 448
 00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,238
 ...has been one nonstop horror show,
 you know, so...
 
 449
 00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,757
 Well, I just want you to know
 that I'm here for you.
 
 450
 00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,912
 Thank you.
 
 451
 00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,913
 But I really do need you to...
 
 452
 00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,150
 - Okay.
 - Okay?
 
 453
 00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,838
 Skyler, I gotta say,
 your sister seeing me here...
 
 454
 00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,835
 ...I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
 You're divorced. So what?
 
 455
 00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,560
 Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
 okay?
 
 456
 00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,553
 - Is there some reason for secrecy?
 - Later. Not now.
 
 457
 00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,837
 - Skyler, just tell me...
 - You really wanna do this now?
 
 458
 00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,355
 Are you gonna make me do this
 right now?
 
 459
 00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,189
 Yeah, you're right.
 
 460
 00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,749
 Bad idea to come here.
 
 461
 00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,272
 Ted, I'm...
 
 462
 00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,031
 I'll see you in a day or two.
 
 463
 00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,359
 Back at the office.
 
 464
 00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,790
 Take as much time as you want.
 
 465
 00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,193
 I can't believe
 you had to crush the RV.
 
 466
 00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,239
 Must've been, like, depressing.
 
 467
 00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,039
 For real. That's a stone loss.
 
 468
 00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,918
 No one misses it more than me.
 
 469
 00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,674
 Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
 
 470
 00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,479
 No quotas, no one to answer to.
 
 471
 00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,909
 What's the point of being an outlaw
 when you got responsibilities?
 
 472
 00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,994
 Darth Vader had responsibilities.
 He was responsible for the Death Star.
 
 473
 00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,958
 True that. Two of them bitches.
 
 474
 00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,953
 Just saying. Devil's advocate.
 
 475
 00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,193
 I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
 That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.
 
 476
 00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,510
 - Church.
 - Right.
 
 477
 00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,993
 Let's kick it back into gear.
 All right? Let's start slinging again.
 
 478
 00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,237
 - Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
 - Hells yeah, bitches.
 
 479
 00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,552
 We don't need no RV. All we need is
 a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.
 
 480
 00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,996
 No, no. No shake-and-bake.
 Where's your self-respect? Come on.
 
 481
 00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,310
 Ain't top-shelf,
 but we could at least move it.
 
 482
 00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
 Still kind of dry out there.
 It'll sell on the street.
 
 483
 00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,191
 And who says we sell on the street?
 
 484
 00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,590
 Maybe I know a whole new market.
 
 485
 00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,718
 Maybe all we need is the meth.
 
 486
 00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,834
 What's the yield?
 
 487
 00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,913
 Hey.
 
 488
 00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,916
 The yield. Come on.
 
 489
 00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,274
 Two-oh-one-point-eight.
 
 490
 00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,750
 I see a couple new faces.
 
 491
 00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,673
 Anybody wanna introduce
 themselves?
 
 492
 00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,036
 Don't all speak at once.
 
 493
 00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,349
 Yeah.
 
 494
 00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,797
 So my name's Brandon.
 
 495
 00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,078
 Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
 something about yourself?
 
 496
 00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,357
 Well, why I'm here...
 
 497
 00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,751
 ...it's just one thing.
 
 498
 00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,198
 It's meth.
 
 499
 00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,918
 It's bad.
 
 500
 00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,799
 Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
 you know.
 
 501
 00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,872
 But then, Jesus...
 
 502
 00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,992
 ...this new version of it
 hit the streets...
 
 503
 00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,991
 ...and, wow.
 - Not that blue stuff.
 
 504
 00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,955
 Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.
 
 505
 00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,031
 No, go ahead. This is what we do.
 
 506
 00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,760
 Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.
 
 507
 00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,074
 - You had it too?
 - Yeah, bro.
 
 508
 00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,515
 I wish I never even heard of it.
 
 509
 00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,353
 It was like lighting my whole head
 on fire.
 
 510
 00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,080
 Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.
 
 511
 00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,030
 Only reason I have a hope in hell
 is because it's long gone.
 
 512
 00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,879
 That's the shame of it.
 
 513
 00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,713
 No, no, man. Don't tell me that.
 
 514
 00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,791
 I hear it's back in town.
 
 515
 00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,110
 Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.
 
 516
 00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,877
 It's gonna be okay.
 
 517
 00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,355
 I swear to God, I'll do it.
 I will go to the press.
 
 518
 00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,354
 I'll go to 48 Hours. I'll go to Nightline.
 Don't know if there's Nightline anymore.
 
 519
 00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,671
 Doesn't matter. They will all take it
 and they will run with it...
 
 520
 00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,631
 ...because he is a hero and he is not
 going to be in a wheelchair at 43.
 
 521
 00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,551
 Jesus.
 
 522
 00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,477
 Listen, Marie.
 
 523
 00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,198
 I know Skyler's
 already told you this...
 
 524
 00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,319
 ...but if there's ever anything
 that you need, anything at all...
 
 525
 00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,235
 It's good to have you here.
 
 526
 00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,518
 Both of you.
 
 527
 00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,872
 I just wish there was something more
 that we could do.
 
 528
 00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,198
 Walt.
 
 529
 00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,277
 We can always pay their bills.
 
 530
 00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,795
 Please,
 it's tens of thousands of dollars.
 
 531
 00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,669
 We have the money, more than enough.
 Walt earned it.
 
 532
 00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,832
 - Skyler.
 - I think Marie should know the truth.
 
 533
 00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,788
 Skyler, I really don't think
 this is a good idea.
 
 534
 00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,633
 - I think that...
 - He... earned it gambling.
 
 535
 00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,828
 Walt and I...
 
 536
 00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,230
 ...we've had our problems lately.
 You know that.
 
 537
 00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,713
 And what it all came down to really...
 
 538
 00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,758
 ...was money.
 
 539
 00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,151
 Pure and simple.
 
 540
 00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,835
 When Walt was diagnosed...
 
 541
 00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,437
 ...it changed him.
 
 542
 00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,752
 And looking back, I don't think
 I ever really understood...
 
 543
 00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,354
 ...what it was
 that he was going through.
 
 544
 00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,988
 It was more than facing death.
 
 545
 00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,277
 It was knowing
 that he was gonna leave behind...
 
 546
 00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,912
 ...nothing.
 
 547
 00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,148
 And so that's how this all started.
 For better or worse...
 
 548
 00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,756
 ...he wanted to provide.
 
 549
 00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,871
 And so he paid his medical bills
 the only way he knew how.
 
 550
 00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,795
 I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
 paid for your treatment.
 
 551
 00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,916
 Yeah, I thought so too.
 
 552
 00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,277
 The truth is he never took their money.
 Not a dime.
 
 553
 00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,679
 He was too proud to take
 what he considered to be charity.
 
 554
 00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,749
 Isn't that right?
 
 555
 00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,838
 So he put his mind to it and...
 
 556
 00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,839
 Well, you know how Walt is.
 
 557
 00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,911
 He's a problem-solver.
 
 558
 00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,835
 And he read books and he did
 a whole bunch of research...
 
 559
 00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,630
 ...and he came up with this system.
 
 560
 00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,597
 A system?
 
 561
 00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,710
 A system for counting cards
 in blackjack.
 
 562
 00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,031
 What do you mean, like Rain Man?
 
 563
 00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,593
 Well, I don't pretend to understand,
 you know, all the details...
 
 564
 00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,754
 ...but he was convinced that if he put
 enough money into it, he'd have a...
 
 565
 00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,717
 God, what is it?
 
 566
 00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,553
 A statistical edge?
 
 567
 00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,749
 Yes, statistical...
 
 568
 00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,592
 - So...
 - Yeah.
 
 569
 00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,197
 So he... every spare minute, Walt was at
 some card table somewhere.
 
 570
 00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,433
 And at first he went to the casinos,
 but then he realised that...
 
 571
 00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,155
 But then he realised that the casinos
 report your winnings to the IRS.
 
 572
 00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,788
 And if it gets reported,
 your family might find out.
 
 573
 00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,953
 If you do not want your family to find
 out, you find another place to gamble.
 
 574
 00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,352
 Like an illegal backroom game.
 
 575
 00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,553
 You remember all those long walks
 that Walt used to take...
 
 576
 00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,838
 ...all that time he used to spend
 away from home?
 
 577
 00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,754
 I guess for a couple months there...
 
 578
 00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,992
 ...you were sort of
 leading a double life, weren't you?
 
 579
 00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,437
 Oh, my God.
 
 580
 00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,591
 Oh, my God, your fugue state.
 
 581
 00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,712
 - Was that some sort of cover?
 - No, no.
 
 582
 00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,950
 He did not fake that, Marie.
 
 583
 00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,588
 The night that Walt disappeared...
 
 584
 00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,351
 ...he lost $14,000.
 
 585
 00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,636
 It was his pension fund,
 our savings...
 
 586
 00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,954
 ...basically every last dime
 we had to our name, gone.
 
 587
 00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,154
 He couldn't live with it.
 
 588
 00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,151
 He was suicidal.
 
 589
 00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,996
 But you have to understand that
 as soon as he got out of the hospital...
 
 590
 00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,678
 ...he went right back to gambling.
 I mean, that's how deep this went.
 
 591
 00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,670
 How could you do that to her, Walt?
 
 592
 00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,669
 Anyway, this system of his?
 
 593
 00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,834
 He finally got it to work.
 
 594
 00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,153
 So all this is to say
 we have the money.
 
 595
 00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,198
 No more gambling.
 
 596
 00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,876
 But we have the money.
 
 597
 00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,917
 How much money?
 
 598
 00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,873
 Walt?
 
 599
 00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,158
 Well...
 
 600
 00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,958
 ...it's into seven figures.
 
 601
 00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,151
 Holy Mary, mother of God.
 
 602
 00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,792
 What can I say?
 
 603
 00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,876
 I did very well.
 
 604
 00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,672
 Marie...
 
 605
 00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,916
 ...you will take our money.
 
 606
 00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,111
 Use it to take care of Hank.
 
 607
 00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,589
 Please. Marie, let us help.
 
 608
 00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,710
 - Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
 - Absolutely not.
 
 609
 00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,871
 And I need to keep it that way.
 
 610
 00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,713
 And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
 on his mind right now.
 
 611
 00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,270
 - Can we please keep this between us?
 - Yeah. Yeah, I...
 
 612
 00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,273
 Yeah, I just... I need to...
 
 613
 00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,432
 Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.
 
 614
 00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,040
 How did you come up with that?
 
 615
 00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,753
 I mean, where did you possibly...?
 
 616
 00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,670
 I learned from the best.
 
 617
 00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,071
 Somehow...
 
 618
 00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,236
 ...something tells me that Hank
 is here because of you.
 
 619
 00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,869
 And I'm not forgetting that.
