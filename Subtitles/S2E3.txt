 1
 00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,637
 Okay. That's okay.
 
 2
 00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,639
 Get that.
 
 3
 00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,033
 Hey.
 
 4
 00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,076
 -Oh, God. Please.
 -Oh, jeez.
 
 5
 00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,633
 Please.
 
 6
 00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,068
 Please.
 
 7
 00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,839
 It's a bold plan, Mr. White.
 
 8
 00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,758
 You sure this is the way to go?
 
 9
 00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,114
 Yeah.
 
 10
 00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,594
 Yeah.
 
 11
 00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,235
 You see that?
 
 12
 00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
 -What does he remember?
 -Not a whole lot.
 
 13
 00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,992
 He came in dehydrated
 and disoriented...
 
 14
 00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,794
 ...but once we gave him fluids
 he stabilised pretty quickly.
 
 15
 00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,069
 But I mean....
 
 16
 00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,511
 -He knows where he is?
 -Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.
 
 17
 00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,917
 It's only the last day or so
 that seem to be missing.
 
 18
 00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,588
 Go on in. He's probably awake.
 
 19
 00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,953
 My God.
 
 20
 00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,118
 Walter.
 
 21
 00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,798
 I'm so sorry.
 
 22
 00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,349
 Come here.
 
 23
 00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,755
 You know who I am, right?
 
 24
 00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,999
 Yes, son. I know who you are.
 
 25
 00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,919
 Come here. Give your old man a hug.
 
 26
 00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,788
 It's so good to see you.
 
 27
 00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,711
 How do you feel?
 
 28
 00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,194
 Better.
 
 29
 00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,152
 Yeah. I....
 
 30
 00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,510
 I feel like myself.
 
 31
 00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,631
 Really, I mean, in....
 
 32
 00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,715
 The past couple days are missing,
 but other than that...
 
 33
 00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,909
 ...I feel fine.
 
 34
 00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,031
 My God, Walt.
 
 35
 00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,430
 What a day this has been.
 
 36
 00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,632
 So, Uncle Hank,
 he was in a shootout?
 
 37
 00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,874
 A shootout?
 
 38
 00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,913
 He killed some guy.
 Some big drug dealer.
 
 39
 00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,075
 Uncle Hank wasted him.
 
 40
 00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,840
 -Oh, my God. Is he all right?
 -Absolutely fine.
 
 41
 00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,669
 -Where did this happen? How could--?
 -Walt, everything's okay.
 
 42
 00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,155
 We're all okay.
 
 43
 00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,955
 We'll be all right.
 
 44
 00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,674
 ''And no idea what caused it?''
 
 
 45
 00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,029
 No.
 
 46
 00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,073
 But they're gonna run
 a whole series of tests, so....
 
 47
 00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,068
 ''But what could it be? I mean, did they''
 
 ''give you a worst-case scenario?''
 
 
 48
 00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,318
 I really....
 
 49
 00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,872
 You know, there's no point
 in getting ahead of ourselves, so....
 
 50
 00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,513
 Well, which supermarket?
 
 51
 00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,632
 Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?
 
 52
 00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,434
 -Marie.
 ''-I.... Don't get me wrong.''
 
 
 53
 00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,430
 I think it's just great that, you know,
 he's back and he's feeling better.
 
 54
 00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,358
 I just, I mean....
 
 55
 00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,030
 He.... Naked?
 
 56
 00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,913
 He was naked.
 
 57
 00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,792
 Naked.
 
 58
 00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,513
 In a supermarket.
 
 59
 00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,039
 It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?
 
 60
 00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,429
 ''In any case, I'm gonna get over there''
 
 ''as soon as I can.''
 
 
 61
 00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,552
 No, no. Don't worry about it
 right now, Marie.
 
 62
 00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,113
 How's Hank?
 
 63
 00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,754
 You know, I ran over here
 and I got to see him all of...
 
 64
 00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,111
 ...30 seconds
 before they yanked him away.
 
 65
 00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,039
 You know, you'd think today
 of all days...
 
 66
 00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,232
 ...they'd let him go home on time.
 
 67
 00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,511
 But how is he? Really?
 
 68
 00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,068
 Hank?
 
 69
 00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,234
 He's indestructible, you know that.
 
 70
 00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,591
 I identified myself and told the suspect
 to show his hands, turn and face me.
 
 71
 00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,360
 At this point, I identified
 the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...
 
 72
 00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,711
 ...and observed what appeared to be
 a gunshot wound in his midsection.
 
 73
 00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,356
 -He was shot previous to your arrival?
 -Yes, sir.
 
 74
 00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,030
 Again I instructed him
 to show his hands.
 
 75
 00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,310
 Mr. Salamanca lunged
 toward the vehicle...
 
 76
 00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,910
 ...and fired on me with what I
 ascertained to be an M1 6 assault rifle.
 
 77
 00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,076
 I returned fire and sought cover...
 
 78
 00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,192
 ...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
 to engage me.
 
 79
 00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,914
 When he paused to reload...
 
 80
 00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,391
 ...I was able to take
 an effective shot.
 
 81
 00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,834
 Agent Schrader...
 
 82
 00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,316
 ...what were you doing in a shooting
 fight on your own, with no backup?
 
 83
 00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,114
 Mr. Salamanca's presence
 was not something I'd anticipated.
 
 84
 00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,788
 -I was tending to another matter.
 -What other matter?
 
 85
 00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,678
 An unrelated family matter.
 
 86
 00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,793
 Searching for your brother-in-law,
 as I understand.
 
 87
 00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,358
 -Your brother-in-law?
 -Yes, sir. He's since been found.
 
 88
 00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,199
 He's fine. The whole thing
 was a misunderstanding.
 
 89
 00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,231
 At the time, he'd been missing
 for hours...
 
 90
 00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,796
 ...and since he's in poor health,
 the whole family was concerned.
 
 91
 00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,831
 I was talking to his acquaintances...
 
 92
 00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,190
 ...trying to get a fix
 on his whereabouts.
 
 93
 00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,836
 The Monte Carlo at the scene
 belonged to a former student of his...
 
 94
 00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,032
 ...a Jesse Pinkman.
 
 95
 00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,631
 I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
 when I came across Mr. Salamanca.
 
 96
 00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,957
 And what about this Pinkman? What
 was his car doing at the crime scene?
 
 97
 00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,709
 -Have you run him down yet?
 -Not yet, but we're working on it.
 
 98
 00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,428
 Man, they're like
 Jehovah's Witnesses.
 
 99
 00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,993
 They don't give up.
 
 100
 00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,315
 I don't get it. Why don't they
 kick your door down?
 
 101
 00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,671
 -They need probable cause.
 -Probable cause?
 
 102
 00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,598
 Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?
 
 103
 00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,031
 I told you, this is serious shit.
 
 104
 00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,197
 I'm like an outlaw.
 
 105
 00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,515
 Okay.
 
 106
 00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,038
 Let's do this.
 
 107
 00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,913
 Holy Christ!
 
 108
 00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,475
 You're Willy Wonka.
 
 109
 00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,319
 You are Willy Wonka,
 and I got the golden ticket.
 
 110
 00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,473
 Put me on your magical boat, man.
 
 111
 00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,672
 Sail me down
 your chocolaty river of meth.
 
 112
 00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,154
 So where you keep the pseudo?
 
 113
 00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,955
 It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
 Aqueous methylamine.
 
 114
 00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,675
 With that, you don't need pseudo.
 Come on, help me out, man.
 
 115
 00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,552
 No pseudo?
 
 116
 00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,788
 Come to me, beautiful baby.
 I'm gonna be so good to you.
 
 117
 00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,554
 Oh, my God. Just take this, here.
 
 118
 00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,309
 But I can't just let you
 break this down.
 
 119
 00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,034
 -That'd be sacrilege.
 -I told you, that's why we're here.
 
 120
 00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,798
 -You saw the cops. Right?
 -Sure.
 
 121
 00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,230
 But couldn't we just
 cook one quick batch?
 
 122
 00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,079
 -You know, for the road?
 -No, forget it, all right?
 
 123
 00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,955
 -This stuff has to go, like, now.
 -Dude, you owe me.
 
 124
 00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,637
 I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
 forgetting you just left me stranded.
 
 125
 00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,353
 God, Badger!
 
 126
 00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,996
 Don't mess with me.
 
 127
 00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,516
 Got it?
 
 128
 00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,919
 Yeah, I got it.
 
 129
 00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,432
 Oh, my God.
 
 130
 00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,794
 Okay, that's all of it.
 
 131
 00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,559
 This was a bad choice.
 
 132
 00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,438
 You sure about this guy?
 
 133
 00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,710
 He's totally, totally cool.
 
 134
 00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,592
 He's my cousin.
 
 135
 00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,915
 -Yo, what'd we say, 500?
 -We didn't say, and it's 1 000.
 
 136
 00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,439
 Thousand bucks?
 
 137
 00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
 Come on, where you towing it,
 man, Seattle?
 
 138
 00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,118
 It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.
 
 139
 00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,798
 Look, I mean, all I got on me is...
 
 140
 00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,628
 ...560.
 
 141
 00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,833
 -You know what?
 -Hey—No—142
 00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,793
 Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.
 
 143
 00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,356
 He's totally good for it.
 Jesse's a stand-up dude.
 
 144
 00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,553
 -That right? You a stand-up dude?
 -Yeah, I am.
 
 145
 00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,876
 I will get you the other 500.
 
 146
 00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,195
 Five hundred more.
 
 147
 00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,511
 Your word's your bond, right?
 
 148
 00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,479
 Right.
 
 149
 00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,312
 I saved your skinny ass, yo.
 I totally vouched for you.
 
 150
 00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,434
 What are you doing now, exactly?
 
 151
 00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,438
 I'm giving you, like, two hours...
 
 152
 00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,950
 ...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
 not a cell phone.
 
 153
 00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,639
 You're not using your own name.
 
 154
 00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,436
 I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
 like, what you said, but why?
 
 155
 00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,596
 Why do you gotta go and do this?
 
 156
 00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,350
 They need probable cause.
 
 157
 00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,834
 I'm giving it to them.
 
 158
 00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,475
 What's the last thing
 you remember?
 
 159
 00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,030
 Well, I was driving home.
 
 160
 00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,788
 I think.
 
 161
 00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,315
 And....
 
 162
 00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,679
 Do you remember coming home?
 
 163
 00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,875
 You came in, and I asked
 why you were out of breath?
 
 164
 00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,349
 You don't remember talking to me
 when I was in the bathtub?
 
 165
 00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,872
 No, I'm sorry, I don't.
 
 166
 00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,200
 -Nothing else? No fleeting images?
 -Well, no. I....
 
 167
 00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,629
 I was—168
 00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,154
 I was walking down some road
 or highway...
 
 169
 00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,395
 ...with a lot of headlights...
 
 170
 00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,559
 ...and I remember feeling fear.
 
 171
 00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,633
 -That's it.
 -All right. Thank you.
 
 172
 00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,718
 Well, there's definitely
 some good news here.
 
 173
 00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,309
 The MRI shows no metastases.
 
 174
 00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,273
 Meaning the cancer
 hasn't spread to the brain?
 
 175
 00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,232
 Yeah, we're looking really good.
 
 176
 00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,112
 Oh, thank God.
 
 177
 00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,876
 So, what was it, then?
 
 178
 00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,311
 -There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
 -And considering your condition...
 
 179
 00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,112
 ...the blood panel looks good.
 
 180
 00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,313
 Then what are we talking about?
 What happened?
 
 181
 00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,638
 As of right now, we really...
 
 182
 00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,159
 ...can't say.
 
 183
 00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,634
 Forgive me.
 Granted, this is not my field...
 
 184
 00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,354
 ...but isn't it possible
 that this had something to do...
 
 185
 00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,596
 ...with all the prescriptions
 I've been taking?
 
 186
 00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,279
 There's the antiemetic...
 
 187
 00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,232
 ...the antitussive...
 
 188
 00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,796
 ...the this, the that.
 Not to mention the chemo itself.
 
 189
 00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,078
 And being off all of them
 for the past few days, I have to say...
 
 190
 00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,077
 ...I'm feeling much better.
 
 191
 00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,748
 Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
 these medications...
 
 192
 00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,349
 ...the information sheets
 are as long as your arm.
 
 193
 00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,394
 I mean, it's page after page
 of side effects and warnings.
 
 194
 00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,672
 Right, exactly.
 Could it be that simple?
 
 195
 00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,429
 Well, we'll take
 another look at that, sure.
 
 196
 00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,393
 Walt, I understand that you've been
 kind of stressed out lately.
 
 197
 00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,513
 Stressed out? I--
 
 198
 00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,631
 -No, I don't think I'm--
 -Walt, please.
 
 199
 00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,035
 Stressed out is putting it...
 
 200
 00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,434
 ...mildly.
 
 201
 00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,918
 Well, I guess I've had a lot
 on my mind lately, but as I've said...
 
 202
 00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,712
 ...I'm feeling much better.
 
 203
 00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,480
 Shouldn't we be talking
 about when I can get out of here?
 
 204
 00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,478
 Well, that may still be
 a ways down the road.
 
 205
 00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,119
 A ways down the road?
 
 206
 00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,313
 Actually, I think our next move
 is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.
 
 207
 00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,517
 Now, is that absolutely necessary?
 
 208
 00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,950
 Nobody likes being in the hospital.
 I get that.
 
 209
 00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,316
 But until we know
 what caused this incident...
 
 210
 00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,795
 ...we can't be certain it won't recur.
 
 211
 00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,832
 -That your last hit?
 -Yeah.
 
 212
 00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,235
 Finish it quick.
 
 213
 00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,631
 Show your hands.
 Get on your stomach now.
 
 214
 00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,674
 Get on your stomach now!
 Get over. Roll! Do it now!
 
 215
 00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,397
 I'm going, I'm going.
 
 216
 00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,314
 What's going on?
 
 217
 00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,431
 What did I do?
 
 218
 00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,158
 Jesse Pinkman, I presume.
 
 219
 00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
 -What, man?
 -Tell me again.
 
 220
 00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,755
 Again?
 
 221
 00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,679
 What's there to tell, okay?
 Her and I were partying, that's it.
 
 222
 00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,713
 Since Saturday night?
 Partying for three days straight.
 
 223
 00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,117
 Just bumping uglies and smoking that
 crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?
 
 224
 00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,639
 Taco? I don't know any Taco...
 
 225
 00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,308
 ...and I damn sure didn't say
 anything about no crystal.
 
 226
 00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,078
 Three days,
 you must have got hungry.
 
 227
 00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,474
 Yeah, I guess.
 
 228
 00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,875
 -You order take-out?
 -Yeah.
 
 229
 00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,991
 Yeah, where from?
 
 230
 00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,715
 You get yourself a little
 of that moo goo gai pan...
 
 231
 00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,956
 ...from that chink place
 around the corner?
 
 232
 00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,709
 No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
 from the vending machine.
 
 233
 00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,478
 You know, Funyuns.
 
 234
 00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,079
 I had a Hot Pocket.
 
 235
 00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,669
 Funyuns and Hot Pockets?
 
 236
 00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,438
 You didn't notice your car
 was gone?
 
 237
 00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,074
 No, not until you guys went
 and busted down the door.
 
 238
 00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,271
 Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?
 
 239
 00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,436
 Management's gonna
 be on my ass for sure.
 
 240
 00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,473
 -You weren't answering your phone.
 -It was in my car.
 
 241
 00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,352
 -That right?
 -Yeah.
 
 242
 00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,235
 We found your car...
 
 243
 00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,476
 ...but your phone wasn't in it.
 
 244
 00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,113
 You found my car?
 
 245
 00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,273
 You found my car?
 
 246
 00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,677
 Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.
 
 247
 00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,228
 Since we're talking
 about missing property, did you...?
 
 248
 00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,954
 Did you leave anything else
 in the car?
 
 249
 00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,229
 Like what?
 
 250
 00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
 Like what? Like....
 
 251
 00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,150
 I don't know. Like this?
 
 252
 00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,953
 Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
 and 20 dollars.
 
 253
 00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,718
 That's not mine.
 
 254
 00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,638
 That's not yours?
 
 255
 00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,515
 He says it's not his, Gomie.
 
 256
 00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,950
 Gee, I really thought
 this might be yours.
 
 257
 00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,596
 -I wish.
 -Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.
 
 258
 00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,791
 You know what we got here,
 Gomie, don't you?
 
 259
 00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,753
 That's a new interdiction van
 right there, yeah.
 
 260
 00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,349
 Definitely new softball jerseys,
 because we need them.
 
 261
 00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,152
 Good thing Tuco's already dead.
 
 262
 00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,669
 I lost this kind of money,
 I'd wanna kill myself.
 
 263
 00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
 So who's your chief, little Injun?
 
 264
 00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,713
 What?
 
 265
 00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,798
 -What does that even mean?
 -I think your story's bullshit.
 
 266
 00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,355
 I think you know
 who Tuco Salamanca was.
 
 267
 00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,391
 Your car was there
 because you were there.
 
 268
 00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,708
 Tuco had a bullet in him when I
 got there and you know about that too.
 
 269
 00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,676
 So, what are you saying?
 
 270
 00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,711
 I shot someone?
 
 271
 00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,230
 -With, like, a gun?
 -You?
 
 272
 00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,233
 No.
 
 273
 00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,398
 Only shooting you do
 is into a Kleenex.
 
 274
 00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,596
 But I think you know
 the badass who did.
 
 275
 00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,032
 Look, I was partying with Wendy,
 okay?
 
 276
 00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,354
 Funyuns and boom-boom.
 
 277
 00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,513
 No.
 
 278
 00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,472
 I don't think so.
 
 279
 00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,671
 Tell you what. We're gonna...
 
 280
 00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,714
 ...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
 of a girlfriend you got.
 
 281
 00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,512
 And you know what?
 
 282
 00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,309
 I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
 roll on you.
 
 283
 00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,597
 Don't go nowhere.
 
 284
 00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,674
 Where's my root beer? Come on.
 I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.
 
 285
 00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,792
 -I got medical issues.
 -Medical issues?
 
 286
 00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,877
 Like, what kind of medical issues?
 
 287
 00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,672
 You got penis withdrawal?
 
 288
 00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,110
 You got schlongus interruptus?
 
 289
 00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,235
 Wendy, listen. Talk to me...
 
 290
 00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,192
 ...and you get a root beer
 and a tinkle.
 
 291
 00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,277
 -Tell me the last three days.
 -I told you...
 
 292
 00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,914
 ...we were shacked up
 since Saturday.
 
 293
 00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,192
 Neither of you left the room?
 Not even for a little, little minute?
 
 294
 00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,758
 Not even for a second?
 
 295
 00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,914
 For a second? I don't know, maybe.
 
 296
 00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,792
 Maybe?
 
 297
 00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,672
 Did Jesse leave the room?
 
 298
 00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,472
 He did, didn't he?
 
 299
 00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,913
 Wendy, you can do it.
 You can do it, Wendy.
 
 300
 00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
 Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.
 
 301
 00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,917
 You know you wanna go back
 to giving windys, Wendy.
 
 302
 00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,915
 It's you. I know you.
 
 303
 00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,317
 You're the one in the black truck.
 You wanted me to do that kid.
 
 304
 00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,192
 -What?
 -The kid with the crutches.
 
 305
 00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,595
 -The football player.
 -How about we stay on topic?
 
 306
 00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,713
 Look, Jesse came over to the palace
 at 11:00 Saturday night.
 
 307
 00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,593
 We were together the whole time,
 and he never left the room.
 
 308
 00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,438
 And that's all I'm saying about that.
 
 309
 00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,149
 Now, come on.
 
 310
 00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,430
 Where's my root beer?
 
 311
 00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,830
 You wanted her to bang
 a football player, you big bald pervert?
 
 312
 00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,473
 It's a long story, Gomie.
 
 313
 00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,036
 I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
 but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.
 
 314
 00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,277
 Not yet. I got one more shot
 at that little skid mark.
 
 315
 00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,190
 And how are you sleeping?
 
 316
 00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,835
 Fine. Most nights.
 
 317
 00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,275
 Good.
 
 318
 00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,755
 Have you noticed
 any recurring thoughts or images...
 
 319
 00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,996
 ...things you can't
 get out of your head?
 
 320
 00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,349
 How about feelings of guilt
 or persecution?
 
 321
 00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,189
 No. Look, doctor,
 I don't mean to be rude...
 
 322
 00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,233
 ...but where is this going, exactly?
 
 323
 00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,671
 We're starting a process, Walt.
 An ongoing process.
 
 324
 00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,429
 -Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
 -Ongoing for how long?
 
 325
 00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,868
 I just met you. Hard to say.
 
 326
 00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,958
 We could be talking about days,
 weeks, months.
 
 327
 00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,030
 Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.
 
 328
 00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,468
 Now...
 
 329
 00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,754
 ...if this is truly necessary,
 can't I continue as an outpatient?
 
 330
 00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,476
 Walt...
 
 331
 00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,070
 ...a fugue state
 is a very serious event.
 
 332
 00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,316
 What if you were to disassociate
 while driving?
 
 333
 00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,555
 Get into a situation...
 
 334
 00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,591
 ...where you could be shot
 by the police?
 
 335
 00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,392
 We can't allow you to leave...
 
 336
 00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,558
 ...until we're certain what happened
 was a non-recurring event.
 
 337
 00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,399
 Saying you feel fine
 doesn't solve this.
 
 338
 00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,873
 Would you tell me
 about patient confidentiality?
 
 339
 00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,195
 It's very straightforward.
 
 340
 00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,631
 Without your permission,
 I can't disclose anything to anyone.
 
 341
 00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,068
 What about my family?
 
 342
 00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,477
 Not your family, not to the police.
 Not to anyone.
 
 343
 00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,194
 The exception would be
 if you threatened to kill someone.
 
 344
 00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,915
 Then I'd be able to tell that person,
 but only that person.
 
 345
 00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,591
 And you, as a medical practitioner...
 
 346
 00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,870
 ...you abide
 by these strictures absolutely.
 
 347
 00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,354
 Yes.
 
 348
 00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,515
 All right.
 
 349
 00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,071
 There was no fugue state.
 
 350
 00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,831
 I remember everything.
 
 351
 00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,236
 The truth is...
 
 352
 00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,910
 ...I couldn't stand to spend
 another second in that house.
 
 353
 00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,396
 I just had to get out...
 
 354
 00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,195
 ...and so I left.
 
 355
 00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,470
 I didn't think about it.
 I just did it.
 
 356
 00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,789
 I walked for a long time, and when I
 couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.
 
 357
 00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,313
 I got as far as Gallup...
 
 358
 00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,598
 ...and then it was just time
 to come home.
 
 359
 00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,313
 So...
 
 360
 00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,239
 ...being found naked
 in a supermarket...
 
 361
 00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,830
 ...that was your way
 of giving credibility to a lie?
 
 362
 00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,112
 Of avoiding questions
 about your disappearance?
 
 363
 00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,118
 Why run away?
 
 364
 00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,232
 What did you feel
 you had to run from?
 
 365
 00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,031
 Doctor, my wife
 is seven months pregnant...
 
 366
 00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,151
 ...with a baby we didn't intend.
 
 367
 00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,630
 My 15-year-old son
 has cerebral palsy.
 
 368
 00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,992
 I am an extremely overqualified
 high school chemistry teacher.
 
 369
 00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,796
 When I can work,
 I make $43,700 per year.
 
 370
 00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,956
 I have watched
 all of my colleagues...
 
 371
 00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,435
 ...and friends surpass me
 in every way imaginable...
 
 372
 00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,349
 ...and within 18 months,
 I will be dead.
 
 373
 00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,789
 And you ask why I ran?
 
 374
 00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,993
 Gomie, you wanna do the honours?
 
 375
 00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,798
 -What's that mean?
 -That means yes.
 
 376
 00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,834
 -Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
 -Come on, this is bullshit.
 
 377
 00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,510
 I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
 even know what planet he's living on.
 
 378
 00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,119
 Señor...
 
 379
 00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,358
 ...are we on the planet Mars?
 
 380
 00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,792
 Are we on the planet Saturn?
 
 381
 00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,678
 Are we on the planet Earth?
 
 382
 00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,232
 Señor, is today Friday?
 
 383
 00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,999
 Is today Monday?
 
 384
 00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,633
 Is today Tuesday?
 
 385
 00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,828
 Okay, seems like he's all there.
 Let's go for it.
 
 386
 00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,035
 Señor...
 
 387
 00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,279
 ...was this man
 at your house yesterday?
 
 388
 00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,871
 Señor, was this man
 at your house yesterday?
 
 389
 00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,198
 This guy right here,
 he was at your house, right?
 
 390
 00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,550
 Was he doing business
 with your nephew Tuco?
 
 391
 00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,194
 Señor, are you scared of this man?
 
 392
 00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,035
 No, he's not scared.
 
 393
 00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,750
 Come on, Granddad.
 
 394
 00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,110
 Don't you wanna help us out?
 
 395
 00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,756
 Oh, man.
 
 396
 00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,399
 I guess that's a no.
 
 397
 00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,194
 -I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
 -Oh, yeah, yeah.
 
 398
 00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,436
 Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
 in San Quentin.
 
 399
 00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,552
 Stroke or no stroke, old-school
 gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.
 
 400
 00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,639
 -All right. It was worth a try at least.
 -We gotta kick Pinkman loose.
 
 401
 00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,671
 It's all right. He's nobody anyway.
 
 402
 00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,871
 You telling me you buy
 that lame-ass story?
 
 403
 00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,231
 I buy that lame-ass story more than
 I buy he had anything to do...
 
 404
 00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,431
 ...with shooting Tuco, man.
 
 405
 00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,714
 Dad? Hey, Dad.
 
 406
 00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,638
 Hey, can you hear me?
 
 407
 00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,353
 Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm....
 
 408
 00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,755
 What's--?
 
 409
 00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,793
 She did?
 No, I didn't get any messages.
 
 410
 00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,672
 You know, I actually...
 
 411
 00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,519
 ...lost my phone, and I've been
 too busy to get a new one.
 
 412
 00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,869
 I've been busy as....
 
 413
 00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,877
 As totally productive.
 
 414
 00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,231
 Hey, you know what?
 I'm actually zeroing in on a job.
 
 415
 00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,591
 Yeah, yeah, data entry,
 like we talked about.
 
 416
 00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,155
 Yeah, I'm totally amped.
 
 417
 00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,590
 Hey, could you give me a ride?
 
 418
 00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,032
 I'm actually—I'm downtown and my car's in the....
 
 419
 00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,631
 Oh, no.
 Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will—420
 00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,389
 I'll call you later
 when you have some....
 
 421
 00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,031
 Okay. Yeah. No. I--
 
 422
 00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,754
 I get it. I get it.
 
 423
 00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,235
 Okay, bye.
 
 424
 00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,072
 Thanks.
 
 425
 00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,919
 So, what are you doing now?
 
 426
 00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,997
 Waffle House?
 
 427
 00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,268
 Waffle House is good.
 
 428
 00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,515
 Pay phone?
 
 429
 00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,280
 Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
 nobody followed.
 
 430
 00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,435
 So how did it go?
 
 431
 00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,719
 Okay. You?
 
 432
 00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,038
 They sweated me plenty,
 but they finally cut me loose.
 
 433
 00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,476
 -So you getting out of there?
 -Tomorrow.
 
 434
 00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,591
 So who came for you?
 
 435
 00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,472
 The DEA? What did they ask you?
 
 436
 00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,990
 Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
 Your scumbag brother-in-law...
 
 437
 00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,679
 ...took my rainy-day fund.
 
 438
 00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,598
 ''Your what? What is that?''
 
 
 439
 00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,917
 My rainy-day fund.
 Sixty-eight thousand, okay?
 
 440
 00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,951
 Cue-ball son of a bitch
 laughed in my face.
 
 441
 00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,991
 Now I got like 80 bucks
 to my name.
 
 442
 00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,519
 Wait, wait. What does he know?
 
 443
 00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,233
 Does he know it's your money?
 
 444
 00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,829
 No, man.
 He doesn't know shit, okay?
 
 445
 00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,519
 The plan worked.
 
 446
 00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,869
 They bought it.
 
 447
 00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,435
 I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.
 
 448
 00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,599
 -Did he mention my name?
 ''-No. Thanks for caring.''
 
 
 449
 00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,474
 -What about the basement?
 -It's clean.
 
 450
 00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,557
 ''And the RV?''
 
 
 451
 00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,435
 Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
 It's safe.
 
 452
 00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,870
 Can he get it running again?
 
 453
 00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,548
 ''-Why?''
 
 -So we can cook.
 
 454
 00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,392
 So you still wanna cook?
 
 455
 00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,999
 Seriously?
 
 456
 00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,790
 What's changed, Jesse?
 
 457
 00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,314
 Seven-hundred
 thirty-seven thousand.
 
 458
 00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,397
 Twenty-one pounds...
 
 459
 00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,830
 ...minus cash on hand....
 
 460
 00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,709
 Cash on hand.
 
 461
 00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,318
 -Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
 -No, I was awake.
 
 462
 00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,432
 -Want some cornflakes?
 -Yeah, sure.
 
 463
 00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,515
 -You okay?
 -Yeah.
 
 464
 00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,031
 Southwest Aniline again?
 
 465
 00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,395
 What's this?
 
 466
 00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,830
 It's the blue meth we found
 up by your late homey.
 
 467
 00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,350
 Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
 than Charlie Manson was yours.
 
 468
 00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,790
 Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.
 
 469
 00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,231
 P2P, huh?
 
 470
 00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,919
 So, what are you thinking?
 
 471
 00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,917
 The two stooges over here
 cooked it?
 
 472
 00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,917
 Lab said that blue meth's
 the purest they've seen.
 
 473
 00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,553
 At least since this.
 
 474
 00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,270
 -Krazy-8.
 -Yeah.
 
 475
 00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,318
 Krazy-8, Tuco....
 
 476
 00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,077
 Somehow, some way,
 it's all connected.
 
 477
 00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,990
 A simple explanation...
 
 478
 00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,634
 ...only I'm not seeing it,
 and it's making my head hurt.
 
 479
 00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,274
 That's because you're working
 that ugly melon too hard.
 
 480
 00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,675
 It's dead around here.
 Let's get a couple of beers.
 
 481
 00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,713
 It's 11 in the morning.
 
 482
 00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,875
 I'm buying.
 
 483
 00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,274
 You're buying? Holy crap.
 
 484
 00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,199
 -What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
 -Oh, yeah.
 
 485
 00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,795
 Surprise.
 
 486
 00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,552
 You little sneaky bastard, you.
 
 487
 00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,314
 Very nice work.
 
 488
 00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,474
 Thank you, sir.
 
 489
 00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,869
 -What's this?
 -Look what we got you.
 
 490
 00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,075
 -Look at that, I love it.
 -They got the gut right.
 
 491
 00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,236
 -Hey.
 -There you go.
 
 492
 00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,998
 -Hey, thanks, man.
 -Thank you.
 
 493
 00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,749
 We all got you a little something,
 and this is from all of us.
 
 494
 00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,837
 You shouldn't have.
 
 495
 00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,996
 Oh, you sick, sick puppies.
 
 496
 00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,838
 I love it.
 
 497
 00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,631
 You going to finish
 your apple juice?
 
 498
 00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,518
 No, thanks, buddy. You take it.
 
 499
 00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,952
 You're supposed to drink it.
 
 500
 00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,436
 The nurse said
 you have to stay hydrated.
 
 501
 00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,598
 But I'm not thirsty.
 
 502
 00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,917
 Dad. Drink it.
 
 503
 00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,318
 Hey.
 
 504
 00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,192
 Better late than never, huh?
 
 505
 00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,231
 -Hey.
 -Hey.
 
 506
 00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,958
 How you doing, buddy?
 You all right?
 
 507
 00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,116
 I see
 the mark of the beast there, huh?
 
 508
 00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,390
 Oh, yeah.
 Marie stopped by this morning.
 
 509
 00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,353
 They really cheer the place up.
 
 510
 00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,394
 Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.
 
 511
 00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,910
 They're rounding up a wheelchair
 for you, you freeloading bastard.
 
 512
 00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,073
 So tell us about the shootout.
 
 513
 00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,477
 I was, you know, just doing my job.
 
 514
 00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,035
 Whole thing was over
 in about five seconds.
 
 515
 00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,071
 Say, Walt, you know...
 
 516
 00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,874
 ...how are you?
 
 517
 00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,754
 I'm okay.
 
 518
 00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,428
 Really, I'm feeling fine.
 
 519
 00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,830
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah. Yeah.
 
 520
 00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,759
 The doctor is calling it a....
 
 521
 00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,839
 An isolated episode of
 transient global amnesia.
 
 522
 00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,519
 Damn.
 
 523
 00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,278
 Which means non-recurring.
 
 524
 00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,550
 Non-recurring.
 That sounds good, yeah.
 
 525
 00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,113
 Sounds real good.
 
 526
 00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,790
 I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
 You really gave us a scare.
 
 527
 00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,719
 Listen, Hank.
 
 528
 00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,153
 I don't know what to say. I mean...
 
 529
 00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,037
 ...you going out there looking for me
 put you in danger, and I'm so....
 
 530
 00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,755
 Sorry, sorry doesn't
 even cut it. Not nearly.
 
 531
 00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,428
 No, no, no. Is that what you're
 worried about? Forget it.
 
 532
 00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,916
 Look, the office, they're treating me
 like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?
 
 533
 00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,271
 They threw me a party, the gals
 baked me a chocolate-chip cake...
 
 534
 00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,391
 ...like you wouldn't believe, okay?
 
 535
 00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,637
 You ought to disappear more often.
 
 536
 00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,115
 Just kidding. Don't do that.
 
 537
 00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,876
 Hey, look.
 Look what they gave me.
 
 538
 00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,593
 Look what they gave me.
 
 539
 00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,994
 What is it?
 
 540
 00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,478
 That, gentlemen,
 is the grill of the guy I shot.
 
 541
 00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,799
 -His grill?
 -Yeah.
 
 542
 00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,468
 It kind of goes over the front teeth
 like that, you know?
 
 543
 00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,875
 Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.
 
 544
 00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,594
 You know, certain folks
 are attracted to shiny things.
 
 545
 00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,518
 Wow, cool.
 
 546
 00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,675
 Yeah.
 
 547
 00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,279
 I can't tell you how good it feels
 to be home.
 
 548
 00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,037
 I'll get these in the wash.
 
 549
 00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,514
 Okay.
 
 550
 00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,710
 Say, honey, I....
 
 551
 00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,675
 I was just thinking about going out
 to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?
 
 552
 00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,989
 Big Gulp? Slim Jim?
 
 553
 00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,590
 Skyler, listen to me.
 
 554
 00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,953
 This will not happen again, okay?
 
 555
 00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,229
 I won't let it.
 
 556
 00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,789
 I'm still here. I'm me...
 
 557
 00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,235
 ...and we're gonna be okay.
 
 558
 00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,512
 Walt...
 
 559
 00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,157
 ...do you have a second cell phone?
 
 560
 00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,793
 A second cell phone?
 
 561
 00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,039
 The night you disappeared, you came
 in when I was taking a bath...
 
 562
 00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,231
 ...and you were very upset.
 
 563
 00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,838
 It was like something
 terrible had happened.
 
 564
 00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,759
 And then your cell phone rang.
 
 565
 00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,077
 I saw you check the number,
 and then you got up...
 
 566
 00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,635
 ...and just disappeared.
 
 567
 00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,719
 Yeah.
 
 568
 00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,115
 And when Hank
 checked your phone records...
 
 569
 00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,198
 ...there was no call.
 
 570
 00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,950
 No call on the phone I know about.
 
 571
 00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,198
 That is...
 
 572
 00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,038
 ...odd.
 
 573
 00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,069
 I mean, I don't remember
 any of that...
 
 574
 00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,035
 ...but one thing I am sure of is that
 I don't have a second cell phone.
 
 575
 00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,159
 Okay.
