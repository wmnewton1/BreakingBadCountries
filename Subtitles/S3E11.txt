 ​1
 00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,671
 Yo, I thought I was gonna see
 some, like, vaginas.
 
 2
 00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,555
 I didn't say
 she actually painted vaginas.
 
 3
 00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,114
 I said, some of her paintings
 looked like vaginas.
 
 4
 00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,436
 Seriously? Not even close.
 
 5
 00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,319
 Georgia O'Keeffe painted
 all kinds of stuff.
 
 6
 00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,870
 Everyday items, her surroundings.
 
 7
 00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,273
 Some of it evoked an erotic nature.
 
 8
 00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,149
 It's who she was.
 
 9
 00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,230
 Not like any vagina I ever saw.
 
 10
 00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,271
 This chick have medical issues?
 
 11
 00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,550
 This particular painting...
 
 12
 00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,553
 ...is of a door.
 
 13
 00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,233
 Any other doors we can check out?
 
 14
 00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,119
 Like, real ones or...?
 
 15
 00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,469
 You know, I don't get it.
 
 16
 00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,473
 Why would anyone
 paint a picture of a door...
 
 17
 00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,837
 ...over and over again,
 like, dozens of times?
 
 18
 00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,436
 - But it wasn't the same.
 - Yeah, it was.
 
 19
 00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,194
 It was the same subject,
 but different every time.
 
 20
 00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,828
 The light was different,
 her mood was different.
 
 21
 00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,468
 She saw something new
 every time she painted it.
 
 22
 00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,518
 And that's not psycho to you?
 
 23
 00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,672
 Well, then why should we do anything
 more than once?
 
 24
 00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,269
 Should I just smoke
 this one cigarette?
 
 25
 00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,876
 Maybe we should only have sex once,
 if it's the same thing.
 
 26
 00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,635
 - Whoa, no.
 - Should we just watch one sunset?
 
 27
 00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,788
 Or live just one day?
 
 28
 00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,437
 It's new every time.
 Each time is a different experience.
 
 29
 00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,909
 Okay, fine.
 
 30
 00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,552
 I guess the cow skull pictures
 were cool, but a door?
 
 31
 00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,389
 I will say it again. A door.
 
 32
 00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,750
 Why not a door? Sometimes
 you get fixated on something...
 
 33
 00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,115
 ...and you might not even get why.
 
 34
 00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,714
 You open yourself up
 and go with the flow...
 
 35
 00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,394
 ...wherever the universe takes you.
 
 36
 00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,076
 Okay, so the universe
 took her to a door.
 
 37
 00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,950
 And she got all obsessed with it
 and just had to paint it 20 times...
 
 38
 00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,792
 ...until it was perfect.
 
 39
 00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,110
 I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.
 
 40
 00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,397
 Yeah? Well...
 
 41
 00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,832
 ...I mean...
 
 42
 00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,355
 ...some things.
 
 43
 00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,557
 That was so sweet,
 I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.
 
 44
 00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,434
 You can't admit, just for once,
 that I'm right.
 
 45
 00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,798
 Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
 kept trying over and over...
 
 46
 00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,077
 ...until that stupid door was perfect.
 
 47
 00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,119
 No. That door was her home
 and she loved it.
 
 48
 00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,076
 To me,
 that's about making that feeling last.
 
 49
 00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,878
 All right, here we go. You ready?
 
 50
 00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,788
 Come on, give me a step.
 Give me one step.
 
 51
 00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,954
 Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.
 
 52
 00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,519
 You can do this, Hank.
 
 53
 00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,958
 Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
 Pain is weakness leaving your body.
 
 54
 00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,031
 Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
 
 55
 00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,192
 - Lf you can get your leg up, go for it.
 - Take me up.
 
 56
 00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,591
 Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
 and then try again.
 
 57
 00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,469
 Never mind about your coffee break.
 Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.
 
 58
 00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,798
 - We'll just pick up where we left off.
 - Come on, Hank.
 
 59
 00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,952
 You can do it. How else
 are you gonna get out of here?
 
 60
 00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,476
 Don't you have any friends?
 I mean, Jesus, find something better to do.
 
 61
 00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,519
 I don't need everyone staring at me
 hanging here like a camel's ball sack.
 
 62
 00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,148
 Hank, he just wants to be supportive.
 
 63
 00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,197
 It's all right.
 
 64
 00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,751
 I'll be right back, okay?
 Be right back.
 
 65
 00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,672
 Gonna get me out of here
 sometime today?
 
 66
 00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,359
 Sky?
 
 67
 00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,639
 We got our first bill,
 and, you know, if you're still insistent...
 
 68
 00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,518
 I am.
 
 69
 00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,670
 Prepare yourself.
 
 70
 00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,956
 They're gonna start coming in weekly
 like that, so...
 
 71
 00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,998
 You're sure you can do this?
 
 72
 00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,798
 Yeah.
 
 73
 00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,472
 I'll do that.
 
 74
 00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,597
 What the hell, man?
 
 75
 00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,709
 What, I can't work a scale now?
 
 76
 00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,751
 This is bullshit. Just say it.
 
 77
 00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,273
 Just say the words.
 
 78
 00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,635
 You think I'm stealing.
 
 79
 00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,310
 Walk with who you are.
 
 80
 00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,392
 That was the phrase my sponsor
 used to use with me...
 
 81
 00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
 ...back when I first started
 coming to meetings.
 
 82
 00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,034
 It's probably just a different way
 of saying be yourself, right?
 
 83
 00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,631
 But this idea of "walk" also tells me...
 
 84
 00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,755
 ...that I have to move forward.
 Always good advice, at least for me.
 
 85
 00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,473
 I see we have some new people here
 at Group, a couple new faces.
 
 86
 00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,349
 See some hands? First time?
 
 87
 00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,396
 Great. Welcome.
 
 88
 00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,949
 Maybe we can go around,
 introduce ourselves.
 
 89
 00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,156
 Say whatever's on your mind.
 
 90
 00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,959
 How about you?
 You wanna start us off?
 
 91
 00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,073
 Yeah. My name is Andrea...
 
 92
 00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,233
 We don't bite. No judgements.
 
 93
 00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,517
 You can be as open and honest
 as you wanna be.
 
 94
 00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,632
 Honestly? I don't wanna be here.
 
 95
 00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,237
 All right, fair enough.
 Who else had their hand up?
 
 96
 00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,438
 Hey, what's up?
 
 97
 00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,671
 My name's Jesse.
 
 98
 00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,788
 Well, hello. My name's Brandon.
 
 99
 00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,915
 And this is, I believe, Peter?
 
 100
 00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,833
 Right, I'm Peter. How are you?
 
 101
 00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,798
 Look, I just wanted
 to give you a heads up.
 
 102
 00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,315
 It's gonna get slower
 smuggling product...
 
 103
 00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,948
 ...with Grandpa Anus
 watching every move I make.
 
 104
 00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,950
 But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.
 
 105
 00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,395
 - Great, right on.
 - Yeah.
 
 106
 00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,632
 So how's it selling?
 
 107
 00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,233
 Mad volume?
 
 108
 00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,910
 Yeah, it's...
 
 109
 00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,431
 You know, it's...
 
 110
 00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,914
 It's not so good.
 
 111
 00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,514
 What do you mean?
 How much have you sold?
 
 112
 00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,873
 I sold a teenth.
 
 113
 00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,158
 - One teenth? That's it?
 - Yeah.
 
 114
 00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,389
 To who?
 
 115
 00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,712
 To him.
 
 116
 00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,393
 It's not easy selling to these people.
 They're trying to better themselves.
 
 117
 00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,916
 Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
 going on here.
 
 118
 00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,398
 I'm out risking my ass
 to get product for you two,
 
 119
 00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,233
 and you're too pussy to sell?
 
 120
 00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,076
 You're pathetic.
 
 121
 00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,519
 You know what? I want it back.
 All of it.
 
 122
 00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,911
 - I'll sell it myself.
 - Come on, man. Don't be like that.
 
 123
 00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,550
 Selling to these people,
 it's like shooting a baby in the face.
 It's not natural.
 
 124
 00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,870
 Yo, Jesse, it's not so easy like you think.
 
 125
 00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,795
 I will show you
 exactly how easy it is.
 
 126
 00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,038
 - Thank you.
 - All right.
 
 127
 00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,031
 See you next week.
 
 128
 00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,109
 - Oh, hey, sorry.
 - No, go ahead.
 
 129
 00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,637
 Andrea, right?
 
 130
 00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,192
 - Yeah.
 - Hey, my name's Jesse...
 
 131
 00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,118
 ...and I don't really
 wanna be here... either.
 
 132
 00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,749
 Sorry.
 
 133
 00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,639
 Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?
 
 134
 00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,472
 No.
 
 135
 00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,916
 Your dad is.
 
 136
 00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,119
 How'd you get her to sleep so quick?
 
 137
 00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,271
 Are you that boring?
 
 138
 00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,995
 I'm comforting.
 
 139
 00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,597
 I'm a comforting presence.
 
 140
 00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,115
 Hey, so check it out.
 
 141
 00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,391
 See what that means?
 
 142
 00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,549
 Check out the date.
 
 143
 00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,036
 Next Thursday is officially six months
 that I've had my learner's.
 
 144
 00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,037
 Which means I can get my provisional
 and start driving by myself.
 
 145
 00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,555
 Since when? You don't turn 16
 for two more months.
 
 146
 00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,075
 It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.
 
 147
 00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,073
 Look it up. They changed the law
 like, 10 years ago.
 
 148
 00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,071
 Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.
 
 149
 00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,357
 Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
 it's the law.
 
 150
 00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,555
 So both of you start thinking about
 what kind of car you wanna buy me.
 
 151
 00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,236
 I think I'd be good
 with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.
 
 152
 00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,634
 A 'Stang.
 
 153
 00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,953
 How about something
 with playing cards in the spokes?
 
 154
 00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,112
 Makes a nice motory sound,
 you know?
 
 155
 00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,113
 Ha, ha, dad, you're not gonna
 get off that easy.
 
 156
 00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,116
 Well, I think that this is...
 
 157
 00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,636
 We should probably
 table this discussion for later.
 
 158
 00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,270
 Your dad and I have a couple things
 we need to talk about, so...
 
 159
 00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,112
 Okay.
 
 160
 00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,471
 A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...
 
 161
 00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,031
 ...in Grabber Lime
 with a shaker hood.
 
 162
 00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,519
 'Stang.
 
 163
 00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,834
 I'll write that down so we don't forget.
 Oh, darn it, no pencil.
 
 164
 00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,875
 What is
 "Ice Station Zebra Associates"?
 
 165
 00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,630
 It's a loan out, it's fine.
 
 166
 00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,711
 Whose loan out?
 
 167
 00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,474
 It's fine. Really.
 
 168
 00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,038
 I...
 
 169
 00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,715
 ...have a guy.
 
 170
 00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,440
 Okay.
 
 171
 00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,509
 Does your guy know the tax code
 and regulations in New Mexico?
 
 172
 00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,639
 Because there's very specific paperwork that
 has to be submitted quarterly on this.
 
 173
 00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,473
 Yes. My guy is a top...
 
 174
 00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,273
 ...guy.
 - Who is he?
 
 175
 00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,909
 What's his name?
 What are his qualifications?
 
 176
 00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,279
 Walt, this money
 has to be unimpeachable...
 
 177
 00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,829
 ...when it reaches Hank and Marie.
 
 178
 00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,310
 And it is. It will be.
 
 179
 00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,519
 But how do I know that? I mean, apparently
 you can't even tell me the man's name.
 
 180
 00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,831
 Jesus, Skyler,
 do you really wanna know?
 
 181
 00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,519
 Do you really wanna know?
 
 182
 00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,032
 Really?
 
 183
 00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,917
 What a pleasure it is to have you.
 
 184
 00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,311
 I'm gonna call you Skyler,
 if that's okay. It's a lovely name.
 
 185
 00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,711
 Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.
 
 186
 00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,351
 Walt never told me how lucky he was...
 Prior to recent unfortunate... events.
 
 187
 00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,478
 His taste in women
 is the same as his taste in lawyers...
 
 188
 00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,110
 ...only the very best
 with just the right amount of dirty.
 
 189
 00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,836
 That's a joke. That's a joke.
 
 190
 00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,514
 It funny because you are so clearly
 very classy.
 
 191
 00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,148
 Here, please, sit down.
 
 192
 00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,440
 So Walt tells me that you have
 some concerns I can alleviate.
 
 193
 00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,795
 Yes, I do. I have...
 
 194
 00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,636
 ...concerns.
 
 195
 00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,191
 If we're going to go down this road...
 
 196
 00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,318
 ...and clearly we are
 for the sake of my brother-in-law...
 
 197
 00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,430
 I've heard about him.
 He's an American hero.
 
 198
 00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,548
 At any rate, I need some assurances
 that we're gonna go about this...
 
 199
 00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,076
 ...in a manner that is extremely safe
 and cautious.
 
 200
 00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,073
 Fair enough.
 I'll walk you through the process.
 
 201
 00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,392
 First step is something we like to call
 money laundering, all right?
 
 202
 00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,348
 Take your money, represented by,
 say, these jelly beans...
 
 203
 00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,954
 You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
 so I actually...
 
 204
 00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,236
 I know what money laundering is.
 
 205
 00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,788
 - Well.
 - Yeah.
 
 206
 00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,669
 And as with most things,
 the devil is in the details.
 
 207
 00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,072
 So to begin with, what are we saying
 is the source of this money?
 
 208
 00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,753
 That's simple.
 
 209
 00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,993
 Walt here, actually came up with
 a great story about gambling winnings.
 
 210
 00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,469
 Blackjack, right?
 Some card-counting system?
 
 211
 00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,949
 Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.
 
 212
 00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,916
 Well, you grow more gorgeous
 by the minute.
 
 213
 00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,509
 Well, there you have it.
 
 214
 00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,719
 I'll generate false Currency Transaction
 Reports out the wazoo...
 
 215
 00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,237
 ...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
 I know a couple casino managers...
 
 216
 00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,278
 ...who will jump at the chance
 to report false losses.
 
 217
 00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,919
 It's a win-win for everyone.
 
 218
 00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,634
 Yeah, but you can't sell that
 for very long...
 
 219
 00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,268
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.
 
 220
 00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
 We declare just enough so as
 not to arouse suspicion...
 
 221
 00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,836
 ...then Walt's onetime winnings
 become seed money for an investment.
 
 222
 00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,797
 Investment in what?
 
 223
 00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,712
 Drum roll, please. Wait for it.
 
 224
 00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,916
 Laser tag.
 
 225
 00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,757
 Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
 of rollicking fun...
 
 226
 00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,309
 ...in the heart
 of northern Bernalillo County.
 
 227
 00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,235
 Laser tag?
 
 228
 00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,395
 Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
 and kids wear the vests...
 
 229
 00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,313
 Yeah, no, no. I actually...
 I know what it is.
 
 230
 00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,438
 It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...
 
 231
 00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,512
 I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
 
 232
 00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,117
 Makes more sense
 than you two being together.
 I'm still trying to figure out
 how that happened.
 
 233
 00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,353
 Do you even know Walt?
 I mean, how would he, of all people...
 
 234
 00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,115
 ...buy a laser tag business?
 It doesn't add up.
 
 235
 00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,353
 It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
 scientists love lasers.
 
 236
 00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,671
 Plus, they got bumper boats, so...
 
 237
 00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,159
 "Hey, everybody...
 
 238
 00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,075
 ...Walt suddenly decided to invest
 in laser tag. Just out of the blue".
 
 239
 00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,631
 Really? That's what we're supposed
 to tell people, our family, our friends...
 
 240
 00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,153
 ...the government?
 
 241
 00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,995
 Let me bottom line this for you.
 You don't need to be involved, okay?
 
 242
 00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,435
 I've been doing this
 for a lot of years...
 
 243
 00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,398
 ...successfully, believe it or not,
 without your help.
 
 244
 00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,519
 So thank you for stopping by.
 
 245
 00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,560
 You want a beer or something?
 
 246
 00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,191
 Or something?
 
 247
 00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
 What do you mean?
 
 248
 00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,189
 Like, beer.
 
 249
 00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,828
 I'm cleaned out of anything else.
 
 250
 00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,595
 Even if I wasn't,
 we're not supposed to.
 
 251
 00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,671
 Yeah.
 
 252
 00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,309
 I've heard it over and over
 and over again.
 
 253
 00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,629
 You know,
 don't you think it's ridiculous...
 
 254
 00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,349
 ...that society says beer is okay...
 
 255
 00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,036
 ...and a little hit of something sweet
 is wrong?
 
 256
 00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,274
 I mean, what's the point
 of shutting yourself off completely...
 
 257
 00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,989
 ...from something
 that lifts you off the ground?
 
 258
 00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,557
 I spend so much energy
 fighting the urge not to use...
 
 259
 00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,030
 ...and I feel like crap because of it.
 
 260
 00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,073
 - I know, it's just...
 - What?
 
 261
 00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,269
 I can't get caught using again.
 
 262
 00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,110
 See, the thing is...
 
 263
 00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,598
 ...not to get caught.
 
 264
 00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,911
 You ever try that blue stuff
 that's going around?
 
 265
 00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,954
 Just a little gas in the tank...
 
 266
 00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,989
 ...and suddenly
 everything is interesting.
 
 267
 00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,236
 Man, I wish
 I could make that feeling last.
 
 268
 00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,590
 Like I said, I got nothing here.
 
 269
 00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,309
 What if I could get some?
 
 270
 00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,114
 - Mommy, Mommy.
 - Hey, baby.
 
 271
 00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,195
 Your nana brought you home... early.
 
 272
 00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,914
 Grandma, I thought
 you were keeping Brock today?
 
 273
 00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,992
 I was, then I saw your car.
 
 274
 00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,035
 - I thought you had a meeting.
 - I did, but we changed the time.
 
 275
 00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,239
 Grandma, this is Jesse.
 He's from the meeting.
 
 276
 00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,313
 He's like a sponsor.
 Jesse, this is Grandma.
 
 277
 00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,352
 Jesse, this is Brock.
 
 278
 00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,319
 So you have a kid, huh?
 
 279
 00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,913
 What's up?
 
 280
 00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,277
 Brock, huh?
 
 281
 00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,870
 That's a cool name.
 
 282
 00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,513
 Here, give it up.
 
 283
 00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,433
 Brock is almost 6.
 You okay, with kids?
 
 284
 00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,433
 What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.
 
 285
 00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,515
 Okay, Brock is gonna go play
 in his room while the big people talk.
 
 286
 00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,592
 He's gonna go play with his Legos
 and his cars.
 
 287
 00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,591
 - Say, "Bye, Jesse".
 - Bye, Jesse.
 
 288
 00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,116
 Hope you had a good time
 at Grandma's.
 
 289
 00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,510
 Oh, I fixed your blue car,
 do you remember?
 
 290
 00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,795
 The convertible one?
 
 291
 00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,509
 You can jump on your bed.
 Play with your toys.
 
 292
 00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,435
 Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
 and that man...
 
 293
 00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,075
 ...is neither.
 
 294
 00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,233
 I'll admit
 he comes across like a circus clown...
 
 295
 00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,232
 ...but he actually knows what he's doing.
 
 296
 00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,756
 And safe and cautious
 is you not being involved in this at all.
 
 297
 00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,876
 Well, it's a little late on that.
 
 298
 00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,794
 This is what happens when you decide
 to pay our bills with drug money.
 
 299
 00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,192
 Skyler...
 
 300
 00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,031
 ...this isn't just about
 what happened before.
 
 301
 00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,716
 My involvement in this is ongoing.
 
 302
 00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,556
 Understand?
 
 303
 00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,479
 I can't just quit.
 
 304
 00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,796
 I have something of a contract.
 
 305
 00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,838
 But it's all very safe, professional.
 
 306
 00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,958
 Structured.
 
 307
 00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,754
 Like, I can't simply quit.
 
 308
 00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,075
 Where you going?
 
 309
 00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,799
 If you're gonna launder money,
 Walt...
 
 310
 00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,714
 ...at least do it right.
 
 311
 00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,510
 You worked here four years.
 
 312
 00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,716
 It's a business you understand.
 
 313
 00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,030
 It's a story people will believe.
 
 314
 00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,430
 Not laser tag, this.
 
 315
 00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,589
 This is what we buy.
 
 316
 00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,798
 You.
 
 317
 00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,990
 This is what you buy.
 
 318
 00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,310
 Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.
 Nothing's wrong with a free donut.
 
 319
 00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,833
 Hey, Jesse, right?
 
 320
 00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,833
 Brandon, Peter.
 How goes it? Hanging in there?
 
 321
 00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,956
 Can we please, just...?
 
 322
 00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,189
 Dumb-ass.
 
 323
 00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,759
 Sorry, man.
 I was trying to keep it on the DL.
 
 324
 00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,833
 So you and that girl, do the deed yet?
 
 325
 00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,713
 Do what?
 
 326
 00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,270
 You know, sell to her?
 
 327
 00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,791
 What are you two even doing here?
 
 328
 00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,669
 What do you mean?
 
 329
 00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,109
 You can't get your nut up to sell,
 what's the point of even coming?
 
 330
 00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
 Homey, I'm on, like, step five.
 
 331
 00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,150
 Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.
 
 332
 00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,993
 Whatever. Later.
 
 333
 00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,038
 Hey.
 
 334
 00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,794
 Dude needs to come into the fold.
 
 335
 00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,879
 Yup.
 
 336
 00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,070
 Hey, you know what?
 I have magical powers.
 
 337
 00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,719
 You wanna see?
 
 338
 00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,318
 Ready?
 
 339
 00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,632
 That's not real.
 
 340
 00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,678
 It is real. All right,
 do you wanna see something real?
 
 341
 00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,398
 Look at this. Watch this.
 
 342
 00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,789
 Ready?
 
 343
 00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,478
 You like that?
 
 344
 00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,310
 That's science and stuff,
 makes it do that.
 
 345
 00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,394
 - Do it again.
 - Let Jesse... eat his dinner, Brock.
 
 346
 00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,279
 Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
 Wanna see it again?
 
 347
 00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,908
 Could you do a trick
 with firecrackers?
 
 348
 00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,271
 Firecrackers?
 
 349
 00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,989
 You know,
 I don't have any firecrackers on me.
 
 350
 00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,311
 - Who does tricks with firecrackers?
 - Tomás.
 
 351
 00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,598
 Tomás does tricks with firecrackers,
 huh? Who's Tomás?
 
 352
 00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,274
 - He's my kid brother.
 - Yeah?
 
 353
 00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,078
 And we don't talk about him.
 
 354
 00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,789
 Come on, eat your food, Brock.
 
 355
 00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,948
 Can I have a chip?
 I'm gonna steal your chip.
 
 356
 00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,792
 Hey, that's mine.
 
 357
 00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,871
 That's it?
 That's what you wanna buy?
 
 358
 00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,713
 People will believe it, at least.
 
 359
 00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,917
 I worked here for four years.
 
 360
 00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,310
 "Wax on, wax off," was that you?
 
 361
 00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,560
 Hey, how come you guys
 always give with the air freshener?
 
 362
 00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,790
 I explicitly say, "I want no air freshener''"...''
 
 363
 00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,919
 ...and every time, I drive away
 smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.
 
 364
 00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,229
 All due respect, I don't see it.
 I..I vote no.
 
 365
 00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,437
 It makes a better story
 than your laser tag.
 
 366
 00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,949
 Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?
 
 367
 00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,719
 She has a point. It makes more sense
 that I invest right here.
 
 368
 00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,634
 Based on her years of experience
 in money laundering, I suppose.
 
 369
 00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,270
 Let me tell you something.
 If you're committed enough,
 you can make any story work.
 
 370
 00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
 I once convinced a woman
 that I was Kevin Costner...
 
 371
 00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,392
 ...and it worked because I believed it,
 all right?
 
 372
 00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,630
 Has nothing to do with the story.
 
 373
 00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,709
 Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
 because it doesn't have a Danny.
 
 374
 00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,108
 There's no Danny here.
 
 375
 00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,069
 What in God's name is a Danny?
 
 376
 00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,233
 Danny runs the laser tag.
 Danny is the guy who had a vision.
 
 377
 00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,837
 Where others saw a dirt lot,
 he saw black lights, rubber aliens...
 
 378
 00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,560
 ...teenagers running around
 with ray guns, right?
 
 379
 00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,438
 Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.
 
 380
 00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,910
 And when the stock market took a shit
 and Danny got into trouble...
 
 381
 00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,755
 ...he went searching for exactly
 the type of situation that we're offering.
 
 382
 00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,754
 Danny will look the other way
 to keep his dream afloat.
 
 383
 00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,629
 In other words,
 Danny can be trusted completely.
 
 384
 00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,148
 That guy, the guy with the... eyebrows
 that won't quit, is he a Danny?
 
 385
 00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,559
 You buy this place, all you got
 is a big building that squirts water.
 
 386
 00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,909
 You got no Danny here.
 
 387
 00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,916
 You wanna stay for dinner?
 
 388
 00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,633
 Yeah.
 
 389
 00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,632
 Thanks.
 
 390
 00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,037
 What time is it?
 
 391
 00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,471
 Early still.
 
 392
 00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,392
 So...
 
 393
 00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,471
 What?
 
 394
 00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,719
 Thought maybe if you're holding,
 we can do something.
 
 395
 00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,592
 What?
 
 396
 00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,555
 You know, that blue stuff
 you were talking about.
 
 397
 00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,473
 - Maybe you had a line on some?
 - Wait.
 
 398
 00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,278
 What?
 
 399
 00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,110
 Thought you said
 the kid is coming home.
 
 400
 00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,153
 Yeah, in a few hours.
 
 401
 00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,476
 And you seriously wanna get high?
 
 402
 00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,629
 I don't know what
 you're getting pissed about.
 
 403
 00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,995
 You're the one who brought it up
 the other day.
 
 404
 00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,709
 Yeah, that was before
 I found out you got a kid.
 
 405
 00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,758
 What kind of mother are you?
 
 406
 00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,239
 What?
 
 407
 00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,154
 You heard me. What kind of mom
 gets wasted with a little kid to take care of?
 
 408
 00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,391
 Nobody can say
 I don't take care of my son.
 
 409
 00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,437
 You gonna come in my house
 and judge me?
 
 410
 00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,717
 Like you got no responsibilities
 so it's okay for you to get high?
 
 411
 00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,233
 What do you know about me?
 
 412
 00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,960
 I take care of my baby.
 I'll do anything for him.
 
 413
 00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,317
 The day Brock was born, I swore...
 
 414
 00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,230
 ...I won't let what happened to Tomás,
 happen to my son.
 
 415
 00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,870
 I'll die first.
 
 416
 00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,710
 Sorry. I...
 
 417
 00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,271
 I just...
 
 418
 00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,476
 Look, I'll get out of here if you want.
 
 419
 00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,477
 That's what you wanna do, then go.
 
 420
 00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,312
 It's not what I want.
 
 421
 00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,519
 Look, I was out of line
 talking about that stuff.
 
 422
 00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,597
 We both were.
 
 423
 00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,552
 You're right...
 
 424
 00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,877
 ...I don't know
 what you've been through.
 
 425
 00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,270
 You can tell me if you want.
 
 426
 00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,913
 This whole neighbourhood's
 run by gangs.
 
 427
 00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,075
 They run the drugs,
 control the streets.
 
 428
 00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,471
 They sort of took Tomás in.
 
 429
 00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,035
 No dad around.
 
 430
 00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,236
 Eight years old...
 
 431
 00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,155
 ...they got Tomás slinging.
 
 432
 00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,796
 Part of some crew.
 
 433
 00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,153
 Then when he was 10...
 
 434
 00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,389
 ...for some initiation or something...
 
 435
 00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,838
 ...they made him kill somebody.
 
 436
 00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,719
 I heard the rumours.
 I didn't believe it at first.
 
 437
 00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,314
 But then I saw him like a week later.
 
 438
 00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,910
 And he told me, yeah, he did it.
 
 439
 00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,836
 They gave Tomás a gun.
 
 440
 00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,671
 Gave him a choice.
 
 441
 00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,634
 Him or some dude.
 
 442
 00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,791
 So he did it.
 
 443
 00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,073
 Told me all about it
 like it was nothing.
 
 444
 00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,595
 Who did he say he killed?
 
 445
 00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,397
 Some dealer.
 
 446
 00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,597
 From some outside crew.
 
 447
 00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,312
 Right around the corner from here,
 over off of Central.
 
 448
 00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,150
 Just rode up on his bike
 and shot him.
 
 449
 00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,711
 Off of Central?
 
 450
 00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,799
 Like over by the train tracks?
 
 451
 00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,591
 When was this?
 
 452
 00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,910
 Few months back.
 
 453
 00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,036
 What else did he tell you?
 
 454
 00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,433
 He shot the guy
 right through the neck.
 
 455
 00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,471
 Shot him dead.
 
 456
 00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,552
 Just because he was working
 the wrong corner.
 
 457
 00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,116
 It won't happen again.
 
 458
 00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,912
 Not to my son.
 
 459
 00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,592
 Guess what.
 
 460
 00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,948
 People who say "guess what" and
 then actually expect you to guess...
 
 461
 00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,872
 ...I hate those people.
 
 462
 00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,632
 Well, I just heard...
 
 463
 00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,351
 ...about a certain patient
 named Schrader-comma-Hank...
 
 464
 00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,796
 ...who is going to be released
 at the... end of this week.
 
 465
 00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,668
 Isn't that fantastic?
 
 466
 00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,070
 They plan on rolling me
 out the front door at least?
 
 467
 00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,312
 Or put me on a greased plank
 and slide me out the window?
 
 468
 00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,038
 Hey.
 
 469
 00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,109
 I don't care what any damned
 insurance company thinks.
 
 470
 00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,239
 - I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
 - Hank, this isn't about insurance.
 
 471
 00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,678
 I've talked to everybody, they all say
 you are healthy enough to go home.
 
 472
 00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,435
 - I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
 - Hank, you get stronger every day.
 
 473
 00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,556
 You don't need to be in a hospital.
 
 474
 00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,678
 In this condition, yeah, I do.
 
 475
 00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,638
 You'll be just as comfortable at home
 as you are here.
 
 476
 00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,509
 - You'll have all the same... equipment.
 - Same... equipment? What's that mean?
 
 477
 00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,434
 The... equipment that you have here,
 that you need. Short-term.
 
 478
 00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,558
 You'll do your PT at home
 and it'll be great...
 
 479
 00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,393
 ...because you'll be home.
 
 480
 00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,791
 Wait till you see the bedroom.
 I had them move the plasma in.
 
 481
 00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,996
 I know that's how
 you always wanted it.
 
 482
 00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,674
 You only had to get shot to get it,
 right?
 
 483
 00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,071
 - I got you a new bed...
 - A hospital bed?
 
 484
 00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,949
 Well...
 
 485
 00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,714
 You put a hospital bed
 in my bedroom?
 
 486
 00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,592
 Hank...
 
 487
 00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,273
 ...you'll be home.
 
 488
 00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,309
 You get that out of my house.
 
 489
 00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,397
 You hear me, Marie?
 
 490
 00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,914
 Today.
 
 491
 00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,395
 - Hank...
 - I leave this hospital...
 
 492
 00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,237
 ...when I walk out of here.
 You understand?
 
 493
 00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,829
 And not before.
 
 494
 00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,279
 What's a Danny?
 
 495
 00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,192
 Danny's an accomplice.
 
 496
 00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,911
 Someone who's in on the scheme,
 who knows about laundering...
 
 497
 00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,435
 ...who's paid to look the other way.
 
 498
 00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,475
 Now, while I agree with you
 that laser tag is a hard sell...
 
 499
 00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,269
 ...without a Danny,
 the car wash isn't really an option.
 
 500
 00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,513
 And he can't get you another Danny
 to run the car wash?
 
 501
 00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,277
 Easier said than done.
 
 502
 00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,591
 If we're looking
 for someone trustworthy.
 
 503
 00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,549
 What about me?
 
 504
 00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,198
 What about you?
 
 505
 00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,713
 Me.
 
 506
 00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,508
 I'll be the Danny.
 
 507
 00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,990
 No. No, no, Skyler,
 that is not a good idea.
 
 508
 00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,355
 I'm perfectly capable of managing
 a small business.
 
 509
 00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,112
 A legal business, not this.
 
 510
 00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,679
 Who else could we trust?
 
 511
 00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,796
 - No.
 - Walt...
 
 512
 00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,599
 ...I'm in this.
 
 513
 00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,638
 - And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
 - No.
 
 514
 00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,634
 - You are not in this. You are not...
 - We're married, how am I not in this?
 
 515
 00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,189
 We are not married, Skyler,
 we're divorced.
 
 516
 00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,479
 Right?
 
 517
 00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,314
 I never actually got around
 to filing the papers.
 
 518
 00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,277
 Married couples can't be compelled
 to testify against one another.
 
 519
 00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,510
 So there's that.
 
 520
 00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,316
 Jesse. Jesse.
 
 521
 00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,633
 Respirator.
 
 522
 00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,712
 Right.
 
 523
 00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,669
 Yes?
 
 524
 00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,437
 Yes, all right. Okay.
 
 525
 00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,357
 Yeah, I'll be there.
 
 526
 00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,352
 What was that?
 
 527
 00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,270
 An invitation.
 
 528
 00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,956
 Walter, you're right on time.
 
 529
 00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,190
 Please, come in.
 
 530
 00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
 I hope you like paila marina.
 
 531
 00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,474
 It's a fancy name for fish stew.
 
 532
 00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,272
 It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
 it's just like my mother used to make it.
 
 533
 00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,950
 Come on. You can help me cook.
 
 534
 00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,838
 This is a Chilean dish that I love...
 
 535
 00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,389
 ...but I never get to make it.
 
 536
 00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,638
 Kids won't eat it.
 
 537
 00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,277
 But...
 
 538
 00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,751
 ...you know how that is.
 
 539
 00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,473
 Sure.
 
 540
 00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,553
 Do you mind?
 
 541
 00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,113
 Would you slice the garlic?
 
 542
 00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,757
 Very thin.
 
 543
 00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,674
 Why did you invite me here?
 
 544
 00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,071
 We're working together...
 
 545
 00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,470
 ...why not break bread together?
 
 546
 00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,794
 Now, the garlic?
 
 547
 00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,955
 It always amazes me the way the
 senses work in connection to memory.
 
 548
 00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,317
 I mean, this stew is simply
 an amalgam of ingredients.
 
 549
 00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,155
 Taken separately, these ingredients
 alone don't remind me of anything.
 
 550
 00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,390
 I mean, not very much at all.
 
 551
 00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,759
 But in this precise combination,
 the smell of this meal...
 
 552
 00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,117
 ...instantly, it brings you back
 to my childhood.
 
 553
 00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,508
 How is that possible?
 
 554
 00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,995
 Basically, it takes place
 in the hippocampus.
 
 555
 00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,759
 Neural connections are formed.
 
 556
 00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,276
 The senses make the neurons
 express signals...
 
 557
 00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,275
 ...that go right back to the same part
 of the brain as before.
 
 558
 00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,630
 Where memory is stored.
 
 559
 00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,148
 It's something called
 relational memory.
 
 560
 00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,556
 Don't quote me on that, I'm...
 
 561
 00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,474
 I'm rusty on my biology.
 
 562
 00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,835
 That's very interesting.
 
 563
 00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,438
 Walter...
 
 564
 00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,955
 ...I would like to help you, if I could.
 
 565
 00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,836
 Help me how?
 
 566
 00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,390
 Well, when I first started out,
 I made a lot of mistakes.
 
 567
 00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,352
 More than I care to admit.
 
 568
 00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,834
 I wish I'd had someone
 to advise me...
 
 569
 00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,591
 ...because this life of ours...
 
 570
 00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,479
 ...it can overwhelm.
 
 571
 00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,960
 You are a wealthy man now.
 
 572
 00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,354
 And one must learn to be rich.
 
 573
 00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,717
 To be poor, anyone can manage.
 
 574
 00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,432
 What advice do you have for me?
 
 575
 00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,599
 Never make the same mistake twice.
 
 576
 00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,358
 Hey.
 
 577
 00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,553
 What's up?
 
 578
 00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,595
 You...? You Tomás?
 
 579
 00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,557
 I heard you were the man.
 
 580
 00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,438
 Yeah, what you want?
 
 581
 00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,471
 Crystal.
 
 582
 00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,632
 You think you could hook me up?
 
 583
 00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,395
 - Three hundred.
 - For a teenth?
 
 584
 00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,630
 Shit, come on, yo.
 
 585
 00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,870
 Three hundred.
 
 586
 00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,230
 Hey, what's up?
 
 587
 00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,996
 Hey, yo.
 
 588
 00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,392
 Bounce.
