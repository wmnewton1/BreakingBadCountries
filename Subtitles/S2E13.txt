 1
 00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,431
 Come on.
 
 2
 00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,558
 Come on.
 
 3
 00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,712
 Come....
 
 4
 00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,639
 Come on. Come on, baby.
 
 5
 00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,070
 Please, please. Come on, come on.
 Come on!
 
 6
 00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,355
 Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
 
 7
 00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,913
 Yeah.
 
 8
 00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,873
 Slow down. Slow—Slow down.
 
 9
 00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,992
 And just—Just take a deep breath.
 
 10
 00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,753
 Do it.
 
 11
 00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,919
 All right.
 
 12
 00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,552
 Now, what happened?
 
 13
 00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,469
 All right. All right. Now...
 
 14
 00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,598
 ...listen—Listen to me.
 Are you listening?
 
 15
 00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,153
 Everything is gonna be okay.
 I promise.
 
 16
 00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,316
 No, no—Listen. Calm down.
 
 17
 00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,953
 Just....
 
 18
 00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,190
 Sit tight. I know who to call.
 
 19
 00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,555
 Saul Goodman sent me.
 
 20
 00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,434
 Come on. Inside.
 
 21
 00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,278
 Watch the door.
 
 22
 00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,912
 Where is she?
 
 23
 00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,075
 Any other drugs in the house?
 
 24
 00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,676
 Think hard.
 Your freedom depends on it.
 
 25
 00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,551
 What about guns?
 You got any guns in the house?
 
 26
 00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,473
 Here's your story.
 
 27
 00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,070
 You woke up. You found her.
 That's all you know.
 
 28
 00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,079
 Say it.
 
 29
 00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,438
 Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know."
 
 30
 00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,194
 Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know."
 
 31
 00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,197
 I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know.
 
 32
 00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,675
 Again.
 
 33
 00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,397
 I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know.
 
 34
 00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,113
 Again. Again.
 
 35
 00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,153
 I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know.
 
 36
 00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,591
 I woke up. I found her.
 That's all I know.
 
 37
 00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,598
 Once you call,
 the people who show up...
 
 38
 00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,268
 ...will be with
 the Office of Medical Investigations.
 
 39
 00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,755
 That's primarily who you'll talk to.
 
 40
 00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,155
 Police officers may arrive,
 they may not.
 
 41
 00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,351
 Depends on how busy
 a morning they're having.
 
 42
 00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,949
 Typically, ODs are not
 a high-priority call.
 
 43
 00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,318
 There's nothing to incriminate you...
 
 44
 00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,750
 ...so I'd be amazed
 if you got placed under arrest.
 
 45
 00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,151
 However, if you do, you say nothing.
 
 46
 00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,396
 You tell them
 you just want your lawyer.
 
 47
 00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,716
 Then you call Saul Goodman.
 
 48
 00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,194
 And do I need to state the obvious?
 
 49
 00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,149
 I was not here.
 
 50
 00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,513
 You put on a long-sleeved shirt...
 
 51
 00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,551
 ...and cover
 those track marks on your arm.
 
 52
 00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,591
 Count down from 20,
 and then you dial.
 
 53
 00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,756
 Hang tough.
 You're in the home stretch.
 
 54
 00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,314
 Do you want 2-percent or skim?
 
 55
 00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,229
 -Two.
 -Two. All right.
 
 56
 00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,439
 Thank you.
 
 57
 00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,678
 Junior.
 
 58
 00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,592
 Junior.
 
 59
 00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,469
 -Flynn.
 -What?
 
 60
 00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,999
 Flynn.
 
 61
 00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,798
 Flynn.
 
 62
 00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,395
 I'll be there in a minute.
 
 63
 00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,958
 You all right?
 
 64
 00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,997
 Flynn, get your butt in here.
 
 65
 00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,871
 Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
 You gotta see this.
 
 66
 00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,991
 Seriously.
 
 67
 00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,077
 -What?
 -Look right there. Look at that.
 
 68
 00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,555
 Are those donations?
 
 69
 00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,352
 -Yes.
 -Actual donations for your dad?
 
 70
 00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,831
 Total strangers gave us $490.
 
 71
 00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,670
 Twenty-six people.
 Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.
 
 72
 00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,190
 Look at this one. Vancouver.
 All the way up in Canada.
 
 73
 00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,632
 And it's all real, actual money.
 
 74
 00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,795
 It's actually right there
 in the PayPal account.
 
 75
 00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,713
 And look what they're saying.
 
 76
 00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,038
 "Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
 "Hang in there."
 
 77
 00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,036
 Isn't this awesome?
 
 78
 00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,272
 That's-- Wow, that is something.
 
 79
 00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,759
 Walt, don't you think
 a little thank-you is in order?
 
 80
 00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,877
 Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.
 
 81
 00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,152
 Thank you. This is a big, big help.
 
 82
 00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,434
 Oh, look, 20 more bucks
 from Thunder Bay, Ontario.
 
 83
 00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,430
 Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.
 
 84
 00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,597
 ''If you're trying to sell me something,''
 ''I've got four words for you.:''
 
 85
 00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,755
 ''"Do-not-call list."''
 
 86
 00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,633
 ''However, if you're cool,''
 ''leave it at the beep.''
 
 87
 00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,354
 How did I know you wouldn't be
 answering your phone?
 
 88
 00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,516
 I'm on my way.
 I'm gonna be there momentarily.
 
 89
 00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,078
 I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
 ready to go. No excuses.
 
 90
 00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,470
 Sir, you may not wanna
 be here for this.
 
 91
 00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,396
 I just woke up and I found her.
 
 92
 00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,352
 That's all I know.
 
 93
 00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,757
 What's her date of birth?
 
 94
 00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,190
 Sir, your daughter's date of birth?
 
 95
 00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,519
 April....
 
 96
 00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,429
 -April 4, 1982.
 -Okay.
 
 97
 00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,112
 And mother's maiden name
 and place of birth.
 
 98
 00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,519
 -My mother?
 -Your daughter's mother.
 
 99
 00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,233
 Bishop.
 
 100
 00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,037
 -And place of birth?
 -Phoenix.
 
 101
 00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,874
 Phoenix, Arizona?
 
 102
 00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,555
 This is our address.
 
 103
 00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,918
 Do you have someone
 who can drive you?
 
 104
 00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,473
 I can drive.
 
 105
 00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,557
 Well, then if you'd like
 to meet us there...
 
 106
 00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,069
 ...we can complete the intake
 and take our samples...
 
 107
 00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,475
 ...and then you can make
 your arrangements.
 
 108
 00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,954
 Okay?
 
 109
 00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,550
 Now, do you need a card?
 Will you both be coming?
 
 110
 00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,990
 I don't believe it.
 Walt, you have to see this.
 
 111
 00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,111
 -Forty from Te--
 -Terre Haute.
 
 112
 00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,275
 Walt.
 
 113
 00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,315
 ''It's me.''
 
 114
 00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,556
 ''Are you there? Hello.''
 
 115
 00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,837
 I'm just checking in.
 
 116
 00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,188
 Our friend says
 he thinks everything went well.
 
 117
 00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,630
 That's-- That's good.
 
 118
 00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,833
 So listen. Just call me, all right?
 
 119
 00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,795
 Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
 We just broke a thousand dollars.
 
 120
 00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,473
 All right. I'm coming.
 
 121
 00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,718
 Some of you already know
 my brother-in-law. He's a good man.
 
 122
 00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,753
 The doctors say this operation
 has a real chance of helping him.
 
 123
 00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,033
 They're also saying they wanna
 be paid in private islands, so dig deep.
 
 124
 00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,233
 Biggest donation...
 
 125
 00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,159
 ...gets a six-pack
 of my very own Schraderbrau.
 
 126
 00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,757
 Home-brewed to silky perfection.
 
 127
 00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,712
 Smallest donation
 gets two six-packs.
 
 128
 00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,912
 All right. Other than Gomie here
 pees sitting down...
 
 129
 00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,109
 ...here's what we know.
 
 130
 00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,595
 Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.
 
 131
 00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,268
 Shot dead
 by an unknown assailant last month.
 
 132
 00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,038
 "Combo?" I hear you say.
 
 133
 00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,030
 "Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
 Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"
 
 134
 00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,754
 No. He was a dipshit
 wannabe banger.
 
 135
 00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,394
 Now, no arrests,
 save for stealing a baby Jesus...
 
 136
 00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,068
 ...from a Knights of Columbus manger
 back when he was 17.
 
 137
 00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,068
 This dude was so low-rep,
 he never showed up on our radar.
 
 138
 00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,038
 So why am I talking about him?
 
 139
 00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
 Anyone? Anyone?
 
 140
 00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,675
 Bueller?
 
 141
 00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,997
 -He was dealing Blue Sky.
 -That's right.
 
 142
 00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,873
 Now, how is it that the purest,
 most professional grade...
 
 143
 00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,517
 ...of meth we've ever come across
 is being slung by the likes of that?
 
 144
 00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,119
 But wait. It gets better.
 
 145
 00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,312
 Since baby-Jesus thief there
 slowed a bullet with his neck...
 
 146
 00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,476
 ...the blue stuff's
 vanished from town, okay?
 
 147
 00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,478
 Not a speck to be found
 in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?
 
 148
 00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,832
 Well, because maybe
 your Heisenberg's in prison.
 
 149
 00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,995
 So says A.P.D.
 They think they got their man.
 
 150
 00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,509
 I know you don't buy it,
 but maybe it's true.
 
 151
 00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,192
 James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
 A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.
 
 152
 00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,311
 You believe that,
 I got a bridge to sell you.
 
 153
 00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,034
 -He copped to it, didn't he?
 -For an extra pudding cup...
 
 154
 00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,514
 ...every night at Los Lunas?
 
 155
 00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,711
 Maybe if you give him
 a pack of cigarettes...
 
 156
 00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,037
 ...he'll tell you what
 he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.
 
 157
 00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,468
 I've been thinking.
 
 158
 00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,992
 Top-shelf product like this?
 It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.
 
 159
 00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,031
 Raw talent's bound
 to pop up somewhere.
 
 160
 00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,800
 It's like Whack-A-Mole.
 So I've been making phone calls.
 
 161
 00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,231
 Local police departments,
 small-town sheriffs.
 
 162
 00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,469
 Haven't had much luck
 inside the Land of Enchantment.
 
 163
 00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,114
 But outside,
 I've got reports of the blue stuff...
 
 164
 00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,198
 ...making a scene here in Texas,
 Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.
 
 165
 00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,359
 In fact, everywhere but here.
 
 166
 00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,271
 Almost as if somebody wised up,
 stopped shitting where they eat.
 
 167
 00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,719
 Now...
 
 168
 00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,994
 ...I say Heisenberg's still out there.
 
 169
 00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,029
 I say he's gone regional.
 
 170
 00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,356
 Only he's still right here in town.
 
 171
 00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,113
 Come on, 2800.
 
 172
 00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,471
 Come on, big 28. You can do it.
 
 173
 00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,194
 Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.
 
 174
 00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,873
 Fo—Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.
 
 175
 00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,479
 -Yes!
 -Yes!
 
 176
 00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,075
 Who's gonna be next?
 
 177
 00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,998
 Your guy found him?
 
 178
 00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,152
 Where is he?
 
 179
 00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,315
 Okay, listen.
 
 180
 00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,953
 No, no, I don't care.
 
 181
 00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,718
 You have your guy pick—182
 00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,831
 Saul. Just shut—Saul.
 
 183
 00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,191
 Saul, shut up
 and give me the address.
 
 184
 00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,793
 I don't recommend it.
 
 185
 00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,997
 A.P.D.'s been known
 to sit on this place...
 
 186
 00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,760
 ..keep an eye
 on the comings and goings.
 
 187
 00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,759
 Are they here now?
 
 188
 00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,669
 Well, I don't see any sign,
 but that's the point.
 
 189
 00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,836
 Police could be the least of it.
 
 190
 00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,917
 You could just get mugged or shot.
 
 191
 00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,078
 How about you go on home, Walter?
 
 192
 00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,191
 Let me handle this.
 
 193
 00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,153
 Yo.
 
 194
 00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,598
 Jesse.
 
 195
 00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,429
 Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.
 
 196
 00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,438
 -Wake up. Wake up.
 -Hey.
 
 197
 00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,155
 I ain't got nothing for you, man.
 It's all gone.
 
 198
 00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,271
 Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just—199
 00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,597
 Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
 Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.
 
 200
 00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,869
 Jesse.
 
 201
 00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
 -Yeah.
 -Come on, let's get out of here.
 
 202
 00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,310
 No, no, no.
 
 203
 00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,431
 -I'm good.
 -Come on. Help me out now.
 
 204
 00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,837
 I'm good. I'm good.
 Right here, man. Right here.
 
 205
 00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,077
 Listen, Jesse, you are not good
 right here.
 
 206
 00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,350
 You are not good at all. You hear?
 
 207
 00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,077
 Now, you just put your arms
 around me. Come on.
 
 208
 00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,599
 You're gonna stand up...
 
 209
 00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,155
 ...and we're gonna
 walk out of here, okay?
 
 210
 00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,316
 We're gonna take you
 someplace nice and safe.
 
 211
 00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,637
 That's it. Now, let's go.
 Come on. Here we go.
 
 212
 00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,351
 I killed her.
 
 213
 00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,472
 -What?
 -I killed her. It was me.
 
 214
 00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,238
 -I killed her, man. I killed her.
 -No.
 
 215
 00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,432
 Jesse, look at me. Look at me.
 
 216
 00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,993
 You didn't kill anybody.
 
 217
 00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,515
 I loved her.
 
 218
 00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,594
 I loved her more than anything.
 
 219
 00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,157
 No, no. No.
 
 220
 00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,191
 I haven't given much thought
 to the programs.
 
 221
 00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,516
 I guess they should be....
 
 222
 00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,076
 I don't know.
 Just use your best judgement.
 
 223
 00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,555
 There's no yellow dress here.
 
 224
 00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,230
 It's all—It's all black and grey.
 
 225
 00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,719
 When's the last time you saw her
 ever wearing a yellow dress?
 
 226
 00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,396
 What about blue?
 
 227
 00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,751
 Blue's better than black, right?
 
 228
 00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,432
 No, no. Not dark blue. More like....
 
 229
 00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,474
 Not super-bright, either.
 
 230
 00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,272
 I mean, blue is blue.
 
 231
 00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,916
 No. No cleavage.
 
 232
 00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,071
 Long sleeves.
 
 233
 00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,353
 Yeah. It's nice.
 
 234
 00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,473
 It's nice.
 
 235
 00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,672
 Big yawn, Holly.
 
 236
 00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,758
 I know what you feel like.
 I'm tired too.
 
 237
 00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,633
 -Okay, sweetie.
 -Yes.
 
 238
 00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,399
 Yes!
 
 239
 00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,955
 Here we go.
 
 240
 00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,630
 Here we go. Yes.
 
 241
 00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,671
 Would you mind
 turning that thing down or off?
 
 242
 00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,430
 Junior. Hey.
 
 243
 00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,193
 The dinging.
 Just turn down the volume.
 
 244
 00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,837
 -Dad, it's money.
 -Just please do it.
 
 245
 00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,429
 Okay, the noise
 is disturbing the baby.
 
 246
 00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,031
 Marie, slow down. I can't--
 
 247
 00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,998
 Oh, my God. You are kidding me.
 
 248
 00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,552
 Sure. Of course.
 Any day after school.
 
 249
 00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,389
 Okay. Wait. I'm gonna—Let me tell him,
 and I'll call you right back.
 
 250
 00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,919
 Okay.
 
 251
 00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,118
 -Guess what.
 -What?
 
 252
 00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,709
 -You are gonna be in the newspaper.
 -No way.
 
 253
 00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,831
 One of Marie's patients
 works at the ''Journal.''
 
 254
 00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,235
 She told him about the website
 and the donations...
 
 255
 00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,670
 ...and they're gonna do a story
 about you.
 
 256
 00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,835
 -For real?
 -Yep.
 
 257
 00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,918
 They're coming to interview you
 with a photo and everything.
 
 258
 00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,633
 Awesome.
 
 259
 00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,231
 -It'll mean more hits.
 -And more contributions.
 
 260
 00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,671
 East of Scottsdale?
 
 261
 00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,189
 Let me guess. Not talking.
 
 262
 00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,758
 Nope. Not a one.
 
 263
 00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,758
 Someone somewhere
 is running one tight ship.
 
 264
 00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,309
 All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.
 
 265
 00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,192
 Yeah. You too.
 
 266
 00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,638
 Agent Schrader,
 can you spare a moment?
 
 267
 00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,910
 Yes, sir. Absolutely.
 
 268
 00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,513
 Gentlemen, this is
 Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.
 
 269
 00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,629
 Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
 Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.
 
 270
 00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,512
 -Nice to meet you.
 -Nice to meet you.
 
 271
 00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,711
 Paul Canterna
 of Canterna Real Estate.
 
 272
 00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,672
 -Hey, it's a pleasure.
 -Good to meet you.
 
 273
 00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,236
 And Gustavo Fring
 of Los Pollos Hermanos.
 
 274
 00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,431
 -Please, just Gus.
 -Hi, Gus.
 
 275
 00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,358
 You guys make some killer chicken.
 
 276
 00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,075
 Thank you very much.
 
 277
 00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,669
 These gentlemen are underwriting
 this year's Fun Run...
 
 278
 00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,632
 ...and I thought
 I would give them a tour.
 
 279
 00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,308
 Absolutely. Get to see
 what you're supporting. Thank you.
 
 280
 00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,511
 Can you tell us a little
 about your work here?
 
 281
 00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,153
 Yes, the Albuquerque office...
 
 282
 00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,874
 ...covers everything
 from drug-related money laundering...
 
 283
 00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,719
 ...to interdiction of illicit substances
 crossing the border.
 
 284
 00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,556
 Now, the group that I supervise
 focuses on methamphetamine...
 
 285
 00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,638
 ...which is a growing problem
 in the country, unfortunately.
 
 286
 00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,070
 -Terrible.
 -Yeah. It is indeed.
 
 287
 00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,793
 We've had
 some successes locally...
 
 288
 00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,991
 ...but overall,
 the supply seems to be growing.
 
 289
 00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,636
 I gotta tell you, community outreach,
 like this Fun Run...
 
 290
 00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,910
 ...one of the most powerful
 weapons we have.
 
 291
 00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,269
 Anything we can do.
 
 292
 00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,833
 -Thank you.
 -Thank you, Hank.
 
 293
 00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,109
 -Gentlemen.
 -Thanks.
 
 294
 00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,912
 Sure. Thank you.
 
 295
 00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,478
 Is this one of your agents?
 
 296
 00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,468
 Oh, yeah, no, no,
 that's my brother-in-law.
 
 297
 00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,557
 He's got a health issue.
 We're trying to—298
 00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,036
 Oh, I'm very sorry.
 What sort of health issue?
 
 299
 00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,669
 -Lung cancer.
 -Oh, that's a rough one.
 
 300
 00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,395
 -Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
 -Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.
 
 301
 00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,038
 -Thank you very much.
 -You're welcome.
 
 302
 00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,436
 Just so you know,
 I won't be back for a while.
 
 303
 00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,073
 I'm gonna have
 my surgery on Friday.
 
 304
 00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,869
 I'm hopeful it'll go well.
 
 305
 00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,673
 But if not,
 Saul will take care of things.
 
 306
 00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,952
 He's got your money.
 He's keeping it for you.
 
 307
 00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,954
 Look, Jesse, lingering on things
 doesn't help, believe me.
 
 308
 00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,199
 Just try and focus
 on getting better, okay.
 
 309
 00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,116
 I deserve this.
 
 310
 00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,479
 What?
 
 311
 00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,153
 What you said in the desert.
 
 312
 00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,909
 I get it, what you meant.
 
 313
 00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,235
 I deserve whatever happens.
 
 314
 00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,711
 Oh, shit.
 
 315
 00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,192
 There he is!
 
 316
 00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,912
 Walt, they're doing a feature
 on Walter Jr.
 
 317
 00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,395
 We called you about 50 times.
 
 318
 00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,831
 Marie, I thought we were just talking
 about a newspaper story.
 
 319
 00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,316
 I know. But I thought, you know,
 if it's good enough for the ''Journal...''
 
 320
 00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,910
 ...then why not TV? So I went for it.
 
 321
 00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,468
 -This is him?
 -Yes.
 
 322
 00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,999
 This is Dad. Great.
 
 323
 00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,317
 Let's get everyone on the couch.
 I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...
 
 324
 00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,351
 ...Mom and Dad on either side.
 
 325
 00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,913
 Mom and Dad?
 
 326
 00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,553
 How much money
 have you raised so far?
 
 327
 00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,629
 Six thousand, three hundred
 and sixty dollars.
 
 328
 00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,796
 But there's more coming in
 all the time.
 
 329
 00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,719
 -Wow, that's amazing.
 -We don't even know what to say.
 
 330
 00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,230
 It's just—It's been incredible.
 
 331
 00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,556
 Judging from things you have
 written about him...
 
 332
 00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,232
 -...your dad must be quite a guy.
 -Yeah. He is. He's the best.
 
 333
 00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,795
 You don't wanna lose him,
 do you, Walter?
 
 334
 00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,993
 None of us do. We love him.
 
 335
 00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,752
 -He's a good man, isn't he?
 -Absolutely. Ask anyone.
 
 336
 00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,672
 Anybody. He's a great father,
 a great teacher.
 
 337
 00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,348
 He knows everything there is
 to know about chemistry.
 
 338
 00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,674
 He's patient with you,
 and he's always there for you.
 
 339
 00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,158
 He's just decent.
 
 340
 00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,670
 And he always does the right thing.
 
 341
 00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,190
 And that's how he teaches me to be.
 
 342
 00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,996
 -Would you say he's your hero?
 -Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.
 
 343
 00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,714
 My dad is my hero.
 
 344
 00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,358
 Does that put him to sleep?
 
 345
 00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,912
 This one just relaxes him a little.
 
 346
 00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,759
 We're almost ready.
 We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.
 
 347
 00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,518
 Okay. Thank you.
 
 348
 00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,474
 Well....
 
 349
 00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,397
 -Here we are.
 -Yeah.
 
 350
 00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,598
 Relaxed yet?
 
 351
 00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,836
 As a matter of fact....
 
 352
 00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,230
 I don't know what this stuff is,
 but it's pretty great.
 
 353
 00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,559
 Yeah, it looks like it.
 
 354
 00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,271
 We'll be here when you wake up.
 
 355
 00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,760
 Well, I'll be looking for you.
 
 356
 00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
 They'll probably want me
 to take your glasses.
 
 357
 00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,358
 Yeah, you better.
 
 358
 00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,709
 Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.
 
 359
 00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,117
 Where's your phone?
 
 360
 00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,436
 Your cell phone. Did you bring it?
 
 361
 00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,278
 Which one?
 
 362
 00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,634
 I'm pretty sure
 he didn't bring it, Mom.
 
 363
 00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,439
 Okay.
 
 364
 00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,919
 Well, first things first.
 
 365
 00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,350
 How old is that baby now?
 When do I get to meet her?
 
 366
 00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,393
 I was actually thinking
 of bringing her today, but....
 
 367
 00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,716
 She's 7 weeks tomorrow.
 
 368
 00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,875
 -Seven, right?
 -Yeah.
 
 369
 00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,392
 Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...
 
 370
 00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,352
 ...here somewhere.
 
 371
 00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,035
 -She's beautiful.
 -Thanks.
 
 372
 00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,834
 Always a relief to say that
 and actually mean it.
 
 373
 00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,636
 -How's your pain level, Walter?
 -It's....
 
 374
 00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,751
 Very low, basically.
 
 375
 00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,757
 Shortness of breath?
 
 376
 00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,599
 -A bit, but much better.
 -Good.
 
 377
 00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,392
 Well, your margins look good.
 
 378
 00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,033
 I can't foresee the future...
 
 379
 00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,958
 ...but even
 conservatively speaking...
 
 380
 00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,674
 ...I can say that you bought yourself
 some real time here.
 
 381
 00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,109
 There's no reason
 not to be optimistic.
 
 382
 00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,038
 That's great.
 
 383
 00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,677
 That is great. Thank you, doctor.
 
 384
 00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,276
 So when could he get back
 to his normal routine?
 
 385
 00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,710
 -He can ease into it now.
 -Okay.
 
 386
 00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,119
 -And can he go back to work or...?
 -I'd give it a few more weeks.
 
 387
 00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,315
 Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
 and continue to get plenty of rest.
 
 388
 00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,988
 But he can be on his own?
 
 389
 00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,317
 I mean, just more,
 you know, independent.
 
 390
 00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,194
 Yes. Use your best judgement.
 
 391
 00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,228
 Well....
 
 392
 00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,908
 Now, that's good news
 for you, huh, honey?
 
 393
 00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,315
 One less baby in the house.
 
 394
 00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,310
 -Don, hey.
 -Hey, Stew.
 
 395
 00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,875
 Hey, welcome back.
 
 396
 00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,957
 Thanks. It's good to be back.
 
 397
 00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,278
 Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.
 
 398
 00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,110
 Yes. Thanks.
 
 399
 00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,431
 Terrible thing. Just....
 
 400
 00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,197
 But, you know, we've all been
 thinking about you, and....
 
 401
 00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
 -You been doing okay?
 -I'm doing okay.
 
 402
 00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,716
 After a certain point,
 time off doesn't help...
 
 403
 00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,310
 ...so I figured I'd rather be here.
 
 404
 00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,628
 -Focus on work.
 -Sure. Absolutely.
 
 405
 00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,514
 Yeah.
 
 406
 00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,389
 Well, see you inside.
 
 407
 00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,190
 Continue to descend through 1500.
 
 408
 00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,278
 Headed downwind for a left base
 on Runway 17.
 
 409
 00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,075
 Number 26-Tango,
 descend to maintain 13,000.
 
 410
 00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,875
 Truth or Consequences altimeter,
 two-niner-niner-eight.
 
 411
 00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,756
 Pima 311, contact
 Albuquerque Center 134.6.
 
 412
 00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,316
 Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.
 
 413
 00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,953
 Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
 Clear direct to Winslow.
 
 414
 00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,628
 I think I may just keep this.
 
 415
 00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,869
 Sky?
 
 416
 00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,913
 What do you think?
 
 417
 00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,636
 Doesn't look so bad, right?
 
 418
 00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,989
 What are you doing?
 
 419
 00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,634
 I'm going to Hank and Marie's
 for the weekend.
 
 420
 00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,557
 -Since when?
 -I'm taking the baby with me.
 
 421
 00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,591
 Marie will pick up
 Walter Jr. from school.
 
 422
 00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,073
 You'll have the house to yourself
 for two days.
 
 423
 00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,114
 I want you to pack your things
 and leave.
 
 424
 00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,234
 Why would I do that?
 
 425
 00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,477
 Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
 be doing any heavy lifting.
 
 426
 00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,035
 -Skyler.
 -I want you gone by Monday morning.
 
 427
 00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,593
 I want—428
 00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,149
 I want you gone.
 
 429
 00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,314
 Okay. Can you at least tell me why?
 
 430
 00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,510
 Because you're a liar, Walt.
 
 431
 00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,192
 Two cell phones, after all.
 
 432
 00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,555
 What?
 
 433
 00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,593
 Before your surgery, I asked
 if you had packed your cell phone...
 
 434
 00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,509
 ...and you said, "Which one?"
 
 435
 00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,869
 When?
 
 436
 00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,514
 Skyler, I was medicated.
 
 437
 00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,790
 I mean, I could have said
 the world was flat.
 
 438
 00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,955
 You know what I think?
 
 439
 00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,837
 I think you accidentally
 told the truth.
 
 440
 00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,794
 Honey, we have been over this.
 
 441
 00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,877
 Asked and answered, right?
 
 442
 00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,878
 Then it got me thinking again...
 
 443
 00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,516
 ...about all the strange behaviour.
 
 444
 00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,075
 Not the least of which
 was the disappearance.
 
 445
 00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,635
 Out of my mind with worry,
 calling hospitals...
 
 446
 00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,671
 ...checking the morgue.
 
 447
 00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,550
 Your fugue state?
 
 448
 00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,508
 I had to believe that, didn't I?
 
 449
 00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,355
 I had to find a way.
 
 450
 00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,990
 I mean, who would lie
 about such a thing?
 
 451
 00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,908
 You tell me, Skyler.
 
 452
 00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,078
 You tell me exactly what it is
 you think I'm lying about.
 
 453
 00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,313
 What? I'm having an affair.
 Is that what you think?
 
 454
 00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,636
 Yeah. For the last few weeks.
 
 455
 00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
 With whom?
 Who am I having an affair with?
 
 456
 00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,875
 Well, my guess
 was Gretchen Schwartz.
 
 457
 00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,235
 Something was going on between you.
 I just knew.
 
 458
 00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,830
 Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
 to swear on, if that's what it takes.
 
 459
 00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,758
 I am not having an affair
 with Gretchen.
 
 460
 00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,872
 I know. I know you're not.
 Because I asked her.
 
 461
 00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,715
 It really took me forever
 to get in touch with her.
 
 462
 00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,751
 She was ducking my calls for weeks.
 
 463
 00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,033
 So I finally left a message:
 
 464
 00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,915
 "What exactly is going on
 between you and my husband?"
 
 465
 00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,429
 I thought that'd get her attention,
 and it did.
 
 466
 00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,076
 So she called me back,
 and she finally told me.
 
 467
 00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,795
 The money for your treatment...
 
 468
 00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,794
 ...Gretchen and Elliott
 didn't give you a dime.
 
 469
 00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,072
 They paid for nothing.
 
 470
 00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,589
 You refused every offer
 they made you.
 
 471
 00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,028
 But that didn't make sense...
 
 472
 00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,595
 ...because I checked with Delcavoli
 and the hospital...
 
 473
 00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951
 ...and not including your surgery...
 
 474
 00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,071
 ...we're nearly paid up.
 
 475
 00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,994
 Over $100,000.
 
 476
 00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,598
 Out of where? Out of thin air?
 
 477
 00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,392
 But then...
 
 478
 00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,916
 ...I called your mother.
 
 479
 00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,399
 Yeah.
 
 480
 00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,152
 Thanks for that too.
 
 481
 00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,030
 But I thought, you know,
 maybe she has some money...
 
 482
 00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,153
 ...that I don't know about.
 Maybe she contributed.
 
 483
 00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,277
 It's possible.
 
 484
 00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,638
 It turns out that not only is the money
 not from your mother...
 
 485
 00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,675
 ...she didn't even know
 that you have cancer.
 
 486
 00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,995
 You never went to see her.
 
 487
 00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,591
 I dropped you at the airport.
 I picked you up.
 
 488
 00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,153
 You were gone for four days...
 
 489
 00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,989
 ...and yet she swears...
 
 490
 00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,715
 ...that you were never there.
 
 491
 00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,432
 Lies on top of lies on top of lies.
 
 492
 00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,235
 Skyler.
 
 493
 00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,998
 Could you...
 
 494
