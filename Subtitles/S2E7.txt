 00:00:16,272 --> 00:00:19,650
 <nowiki><i>The city's called Duke
 The state's called New Mexico</i>
 
 2
 00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:30,036
 <i>Among the gangsters
 The gringos' fame is inflated</i>
 
 3
 00:00:30,828 --> 00:00:35,332
 <i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>
 
 4
 00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:49,472
 <i>They say the colour is blue
 And the quality pure</i>
 
 5
 00:00:55,644 --> 00:00:59,648
 <i>This potent drug's runnin'
 Through the city</i>
 
 6
 00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:04,987
 <i>And no one could stop it
 If they wanted to</i>
 
 7
 00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:13,662
 <i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
 They weren't getting respect</i>
 
 8
 00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,669
 <i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
 Who owns the market now</i>
 
 9
 00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:27,426
 <i>No one knows the man since
 They've never seen his face</i>
 
 10
 00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:31,681
 <i>The cartel's 'bout respect
 And they ain't forgiving</i>
 
 11
 00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:39,438
 <i>But that homey's dead
 He just doesn't know it yet</i>
 
 12
 00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,669
 <i>Heisenberg's fame has got
 Down to Michoacan</i>
 
 13
 00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:08,384
 <i>From way far away
 They want to taste that meth</i>
 
 14
 00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:14,223
 <i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>
 
 15
 00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,858
 <i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>
 
 16
 00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:37,413
 <i>Looks just like Mexico
 In all the drugs it's hiding</i>
 
 17
 00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:43,794
 <i>Except there's a gringo boss
 And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>
 
 18
 00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:51,927
 <i>The cartel's runnin' hot because
 They weren't getting respect</i>
 
 19
 00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:58,851
 <i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
 Who owns the market now</i>
 
 20
 00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:06,484
 <i>No one knows the man since
 They've never seen his face</i>
 
 21
 00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,863
 <i>The fury of the cartel
 Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>
 
 22
 00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:15,284
 <i>But that homey's dead</i>
 
 23
 00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:18,788
 <i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>
 
 24
 00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:49,360
 Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
 which in turn...
 
 25
 00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:53,322
 You do know what a bond is?
 
 26
 00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,745
 A strong force of attraction.
 
 27
 00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:03,124
 Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.
 
 28
 00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:07,712
 The coming together of atoms
 and molecules to form compounds.
 
 29
 00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,380
 No?
 
 30
 00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:15,594
 Chemical bonds
 are what make matter matter.
 
 31
 00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:19,890
 Bonds are what hold
 the physical world together.
 
 32
 00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:24,353
 What hold us together.
 -Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.
 
 33
 00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:25,563
 Bonds.
 
 34
 00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,401
 Your test score says otherwise.
 It tells me you don't get it at all.
 
 35
 00:04:31,777 --> 00:04:34,822
 Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.
 
 36
 00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,413
 What is "close"?
 
 37
 00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:44,582
 There's no "close" in science, Barry.
 
 38
 00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,710
 There are right answers
 and wrong answers.
 
 39
 00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:50,171
 "Close" didn't put men on the moon.
 
 40
 00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,425
 Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
 two points?
 
 41
 00:04:55,634 --> 00:04:58,596
 Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
 I have to go to summer school.
 
 42
 00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:04,435
 And, I mean, I really studied.
 Like, really, really studied.
 
 43
 00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,438
 Like, all night, hard.
 
 44
 00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:11,942
 And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
 for, like, the concepts.
 
 45
 00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:17,990
 I just think I might have, you know,
 the attention deficit...
 
 46
 00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,576
 Couldn't you please
 just let this slide?
 
 47
 00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,797
 Don't bullshit a bullshitter.
 
 48
 00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,428
 The answer is no.
 Next time, apply yourself.
 
 49
 00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:26,017
 <i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>
 
 50
 00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:30,813
 Are you ducking me, or what?
 This makes the third time.
 
 51
 00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:36,360
 Look, I will be leaving this phone on
 for another 15 minutes, so call me.
 
 52
 00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,490
 Oh, and by the way,
 that thing we talked about, the...
 
 53
 00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,368
 When I said, "Handle it."
 
 54
 00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:48,706
 Well, don't. Just let it go.
 
 55
 00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,416
 All right.
 
 56
 00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:11,395
 Come on.
 
 57
 00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,607
 Jesse, open the door.
 
 58
 00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:19,570
 I know you're home. Your car is here.
 Come on. Hey.
 
 59
 00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,702
 Can I help you?
 
 60
 00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,372
 No. Thank you.
 
 61
 00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,876
 Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
 with the pounding, please?
 
 62
 00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,420
 You're the manager?
 
 63
 00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,090
 Yes. Yes, you can help me.
 Absolutely.
 
 64
 00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:44,178
 I very much need to get inside here,
 so if you have a master key...
 
 65
 00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:48,057
 You have a key, right?
 -Yeah, I have a key.
 
 66
 00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,562
 Look, the person who lives here...
 
 67
 00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,691
 ...it's just very important
 for me to see him.
 
 68
 00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,777
 And you knocked, right?
 -Yeah.
 
 69
 00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:01,987
 He didn't answer?
 
 70
 00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:04,532
 Which means...?
 
 71
 00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,206
 Look, I'm his father, all right?
 -You're Mr. Jackson?
 
 72
 00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,961
 Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.
 
 73
 00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,170
 And you are...?
 
 74
 00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:21,757
 Jane.
 -Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.
 
 75
 00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,926
 Now, if you wouldn't mind...
 
 76
 00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:26,971
 Mr. Jackson,
 I'm happy to let you use my phone.
 
 77
 00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:30,141
 Wanna call him?
 -No.
 
 78
 00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,019
 No. I-
 
 79
 00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:36,689
 As I said, I would like
 if you let me inside here...
 
 80
 00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:40,359
 ...so that I can check on
 my son's well-being.
 
 81
 00:08:40,568 --> 00:08:42,153
 You understand?
 
 82
 00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:45,489
 Look, whatever's going on
 between the two of you is family.
 
 83
 00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,491
 I don't get involved in family.
 
 84
 00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,994
 Jesse doesn't want you in,
 you're not getting in.
 
 85
 00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,203
 Period.
 
 86
 00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,122
 Sorry.
 
 87
 00:08:58,044 --> 00:09:01,380
 Come on in, Dad.
 
 88
 00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,803
 Thanks.
 -You okay?
 
 89
 00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:10,806
 Yeah.
 
 90
 00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,607
 "Jesse Jackson"?
 
 91
 00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,567
 Do you even...?
 
 92
 00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,572
 Oh, I see you have a telephone,
 at least.
 
 93
 00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:30,117
 You know, that blinking thing
 I've been calling you on?
 
 94
 00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:32,453
 Whatever, man.
 
 95
 00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:38,084
 Hey, give me my-Give-
 -I will break this. I will break this!
 
 96
 00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,837
 Damned druggie idiot.
 Is this what you've been doing...
 
 97
 00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,215
 ...the whole time
 I've been trying to reach you?
 
 98
 00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:48,219
 No. I've been taking care of business.
 -What business?
 
 99
 00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:49,929
 What business?
 
 100
 00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:54,809
 The business you put me on, asshole.
 What, you already forgot?
 
 101
 00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,567
 This business.
 
 102
 00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:09,907
 Does that jog your memory?
 Son of a bitch.
 
 103
 00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:17,081
 You didn't actually-?
 -Hey, you said-
 
 104
 00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,542
 You said, "Handle it,"
 so, you know, I handled it.
 
 105
 00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,712
 When I said, "Handle it,"
 I meant fear and intimidation.
 
 106
 00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,880
 I meant get your money back.
 I never meant-
 
 107
 00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,174
 Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
 -No!
 
 108
 00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:30,344
 Well, too late, yo,
 because dude's dead.
 
 109
 00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,430
 Oh, God.
 -All right? Way dead.
 
 110
 00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:36,767
 Oh, God.
 -Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.
 
 111
 00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,894
 Here's your money.
 
 112
 00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:44,900
 Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.
 
 113
 00:10:45,651 --> 00:10:50,614
 Spend it in good health,
 you miserable son of a bitch.
 
 114
 00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,313
 I didn't say I killed him.
 
 115
 00:11:24,607 --> 00:11:26,150
 Tell me what happened.
 
 116
 00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:31,989
 Dude's wife crushed his head
 with an ATM machine.
 
 117
 00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,493
 Crushed his-?
 -Crushed his head...
 
 118
 00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,746
 ...with an ATM machine
 right in front of me.
 
 119
 00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:40,998
 I mean, crushed it like...
 
 120
 00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:45,670
 Oh, my God, the sound...
 
 121
 00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:47,630
 ...it's still in my ears.
 
 122
 00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:50,549
 You know, and the blood,
 like, everywhere.
 
 123
 00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:56,013
 Like, there was so much,
 you would not believe.
 
 124
 00:11:56,222 --> 00:12:01,185
 Man, will you just please give me-?
 Just give me my weed, all right?
 
 125
 00:12:01,394 --> 00:12:03,854
 It helps with my nausea.
 
 126
 00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,441
 So...
 
 127
 00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,695
 ...you did not kill anyone?
 
 128
 00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,532
 Does anybody think
 that you killed anybody?
 
 129
 00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,575
 I called the cops.
 
 130
 00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:19,036
 You called the cops?
 
 131
 00:12:19,245 --> 00:12:22,748
 Yeah. You know, I called,
 and I split, you know?
 
 132
 00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:25,042
 And then they came in
 and busted her.
 
 133
 00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,714
 God, she was-
 She was so zapped out of her mind.
 
 134
 00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:33,300
 You know? It's...
 She did it for, like, nothing.
 
 135
 00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,013
 I mean, he told her she was a skank,
 but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.
 
 136
 00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:42,560
 Can this person identify you?
 Can she identify you being there?
 
 137
 00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:47,481
 She couldn't identify
 her left ass cheek.
 
 138
 00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,984
 She was so zonked.
 
 139
 00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:53,571
 And she had this...
 
 140
 00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,865
 God, she had this kid.
 
 141
 00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:59,493
 Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
 on the mechanics here...
 
 142
 00:12:59,702 --> 00:13:04,665
 ...but could you not stop this woman
 from killing this man?
 
 143
 00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,669
 Look, she had a gun on me,
 all right?
 
 144
 00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:18,054
 Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.
 
 145
 00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,097
 Go ahead, say it. Say it.
 
 146
 00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:24,310
 No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
 I can't run a crew.
 
 147
 00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:28,230
 Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
 Point made. Yes.
 
 148
 00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,740
 <i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>
 
 149
 00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:40,951
 <i>-Hey, it's Badger, man.
 -What are you doing?</i>
 
 150
 00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,955
 <i>-Don't use your real name.
 -What? That isn't my real name.</i>
 
 151
 00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,208
 <i>Okay.</i>
 
 152
 00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:52,755
 <i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
 Thirty-two large, right?</i>
 
 153
 00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,466
 <i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>
 
 154
 00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:58,135
 <i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>
 
 155
 00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,646
 So are you gonna
 get back up on that horse?
 
 156
 00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:12,983
 No.
 
 157
 00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:16,112
 You get on. All right?
 
 158
 00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,281
 I just want to forget. I just...
 
 159
 00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,126
 Sorry.
 
 160
 00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,223
 Hey.
 
 161
 00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,642
 Hey, what's up with that?
 
 162
 00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:51,355
 Jesus Malverde,
 patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.
 
 163
 00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:54,191
 Well, yeah, hell,
 I know who it is, okay?
 
 164
 00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,986
 Scumbags kneeling down
 praying to him:
 
 165
 00:14:57,194 --> 00:15:02,366
 "Please, Señor Saint.
 No DEA, please."
 
 166
 00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,586
 I'm just-I'm just saying,
 why's he on your desk?
 
 167
 00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,506
 Going after neo-Nazis,
 you don't wear swastikas, right?
 
 168
 00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:23,137
 Sun Tzu.
 -Son who?
 
 169
 00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:26,140
 <i>Sixth-century Chinese general.
 Wrote The Art of War.</i>
 
 170
 00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,060
 "If you know your enemy
 as yourself...
 
 171
 00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:31,812
 ...you'll fight without danger
 in many battles."
 
 172
 00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,234
 Right on.
 
 173
 00:15:43,574 --> 00:15:45,409
 Agent Schrader.
 -Sir.
 
 174
 00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:49,789
 Glad to have you onboard.
 -Thanks.
 
 175
 00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:53,876
 Everybody getting you settled in?
 -Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.
 
 176
 00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:57,421
 And gals. And gals.
 Guys-Guys and gals.
 
 177
 00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,341
 Good. You couldn't have
 picked a better time to arrive.
 
 178
 00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,219
 We're about to put a big dent
 in the cartel. Right, Vanco?
 
 179
 00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:05,054
 Yes, sir.
 
 180
 00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,836
 Yo, bro, check it out.
 It's a satellite picture of you farting.
 
 181
 00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,798
 "Fat Man and Little Boy."
 Sounds like you two.
 
 182
 00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:44,635
 I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.
 
 183
 00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:51,976
 Hey, watch it.
 -It ain't real, dumb-ass.
 
 184
 00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,310
 Just watch it, is all.
 
 185
 00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,312
 You watch it.
 
 186
 00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,158
 I'm Heisenberg.
 
 187
 00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,827
 You're Heisenberg?
 
 188
 00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:12,079
 Yeah, I remember you.
 You were the cook.
 
 189
 00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,582
 Let's get this over with.
 
 190
 00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,417
 Where's Jesse?
 
 191
 00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,754
 Busy.
 -Hey, that's cool.
 
 192
 00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,380
 Real cool.
 
 193
 00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,132
 Totally cool.
 
 194
 00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,800
 Hey, hey-
 
 195
 00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,555
 It's all there, man. Every dollar.
 Case you wanna, like, count it.
 
 196
 00:17:29,764 --> 00:17:32,933
 Here?
 -I'm just saying...
 
 197
 00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:34,977
 Just saying, like, we cool, yo.
 
 198
 00:17:35,186 --> 00:17:37,313
 Ain't got no confusions
 and interpretations...
 
 199
 00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,814
 ...as to who we work for.
 
 200
 00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,234
 And that's church, yo. For real.
 
 201
 00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,991
 What have you heard?
 
 202
 00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:53,913
 Did Jesse really...?
 
 203
 00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:57,583
 I mean, did he really...
 
 204
 00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,630
 ...squash that dude's head
 with an ATM machine?
 
 205
 00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,173
 Word.
 
 206
 00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,680
 Who's saying that?
 
 207
 00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:14,934
 Damn, man, it's all over town.
 Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."
 
 208
 00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:17,812
 Usually I gotta chase dudes down
 for their money...
 
 209
 00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,772
 ...but today everybody's paying up.
 
 210
 00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,900
 True that. Serious.
 
 211
 00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:24,985
 But, like...
 
 212
 00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:27,863
 He really did it?
 
 213
 00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:40,167
 You didn't hear that from me.
 
 214
 00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,157
 Big lunch.
 
 215
 00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,585
 Thank you.
 
 216
 00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:30,676
 Here you go.
 -Very good, Ms. White.
 
 217
 00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:33,596
 We'll consider your application
 and let you know.
 
 218
 00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:35,097
 Thank you.
 
 219
 00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,351
 I'd just like to mention
 that I have worked here before.
 
 220
 00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,685
 Really?
 
 221
 00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,771
 When are you due?
 
 222
 00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:46,984
 Several months.
 -Congratulations.
 
 223
 00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:51,947
 I see. Accounting Department.
 You left us four years ago?
 
 224
 00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:53,574
 Family.
 
 225
 00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,787
 We'll definitely let you know.
 Thank you for coming by.
 
 226
 00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:07,463
 Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
 I-I think he'll remember me.
 
 227
 00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,466
 Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
 unfortunately.
 
 228
 00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,968
 You know, if it's okay, I'll just-
 
 229
 00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,639
 Ma'am-
 
 230
 00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:33,447
 Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.
 
 231
 00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:35,157
 Hey, Ted.
 
 232
 00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,660
 Come in, come in.
 -Okay.
 
 233
 00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:40,496
 No calls, Margaret, thanks.
 
 234
 00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:42,206
 Come on, sit down right here.
 
 235
 00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,667
 Okay. Thank you.
 
 236
 00:20:48,004 --> 00:20:51,507
 You look great.
 -Oh, yeah, yeah.
 
 237
 00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:53,968
 Boy or girl?
 Or are you keeping it a secret?
 
 238
 00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:56,512
 Oh, it's a little girl.
 We're very excited.
 
 239
 00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:59,473
 I'll bet. One of each.
 
 240
 00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:01,934
 How's Walt Jr.?
 
 241
 00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:05,771
 Oh, 10th grade,
 and he's just growing like a weed.
 
 242
 00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,523
 He's-He's taller than I am now.
 
 243
 00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,571
 Yeah. I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
 by the time he's finished.
 
 244
 00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,323
 And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.
 
 245
 00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,117
 Good genes.
 
 246
 00:21:21,746 --> 00:21:26,000
 Speaking of movie stars,
 those can't be the twins.
 
 247
 00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,377
 Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.
 
 248
 00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,713
 They're gorgeous.
 -Yes, they are.
 
 249
 00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,549
 And they know it.
 
 250
 00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:35,551
 I'm in real trouble there, huh?
 
 251
 00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,428
 Yeah.
 
 252
 00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,766
 So the big office, huh?
 
 253
 00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,684
 Yeah.
 -Yeah.
 
 254
 00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:45,853
 Weird, isn't it?
 
 255
 00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,397
 I still think of it as my dad's.
 
 256
 00:21:48,606 --> 00:21:49,940
 I miss him.
 
 257
 00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:51,692
 Me too.
 
 258
 00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:57,740
 I'd like to think he'd be proud.
 Last year was our best year yet.
 
 259
 00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,076
 Yeah, he'd be proud.
 
 260
 00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:03,788
 Walt? How's he doing?
 
 261
 00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:08,959
 Oh, he's-He is doing great.
 Yeah. He's plugging away.
 
 262
 00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,588
 Great. He's still teaching?
 -Yeah.
 
 263
 00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:17,593
 You tell him I said hello.
 -I will definitely do that.
 
 264
 00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:26,727
 To be honest, Ted,
 I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...
 
 265
 00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,232
 I was applying for the data-entry job.
 
 266
 00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:34,276
 You're kidding.
 
 267
 00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:36,779
 Skyler, you were, like,
 our go-to bookkeeper.
 
 268
 00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:39,448
 Yeah. Well...
 
 269
 00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:42,118
 ...the economy, you know, so...
 
 270
 00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:45,871
 Well, you, data entry?
 That'd be a mistake.
 
 271
 00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:51,585
 How about...
 
 272
 00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,588
 ...get your old job back?
 
 273
 00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:00,636
 We're expanding, and, well,
 between you and me...
 
 274
 00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:03,139
 ...the whole department's
 pretty much of a mess.
 
 275
 00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,058
 Your work would be cut out for you...
 
 276
 00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,978
 ...but we could use your help.
 
 277
 00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,485
 Okay.
 
 278
 00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:22,491
 All right. Now, this is our territory,
 right? Currently.
 
 279
 00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,993
 Hey. Hello.
 
 280
 00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,537
 Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
 -Now, look at this.
 
 281
 00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:28,664
 Here, here, here and here.
 
 282
 00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,959
 What does that look like to you?
 
 283
 00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:36,589
 Opportunities. Golden ones.
 That's what that looks like.
 
 284
 00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:40,384
 No, look.
 Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.
 
 285
 00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,345
 Now, why aren't we exploiting that?
 
 286
 00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:46,015
 Because it's not our territory?
 -Because we lack initiative.
 
 287
 00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,516
 Initiative.
 -Yes.
 
 288
 00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:49,685
 You need to employ more dealers.
 
 289
 00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,229
 Double, triple your crew.
 Those three I met?
 
 290
 00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:56,692
 They should each have three, six, nine
 sub-dealers working for them.
 
 291
 00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,944
 Exponential growth,
 that's the key here.
 
 292
 00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:04,909
 It's not our territory, man.
 Yo, you follow me here, huh?
 
 293
 00:24:05,117 --> 00:24:07,787
 We go rolling into
 these neighbourhoods...
 
 294
 00:24:07,995 --> 00:24:10,831
 ...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
 you understand?
 
 295
 00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,709
 Sure, they won't like it...
 
 296
 00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,796
 ...but I say they're not gonna
 do a thing about it.
 
 297
 00:24:17,004 --> 00:24:18,964
 No. Listen, Jesse-
 -No.
 
 298
 00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:20,800
 Jesse.
 
 299
 00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:28,015
 The game has changed.
 The word is out that you are a killer.
 
 300
 00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,019
 What are you talking about?
 -Apparently, it's all over town.
 
 301
 00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:34,730
 Somebody crossed you,
 you got angry...
 
 302
 00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:38,025
 ...you crushed their skull
 with an ATM machine.
 
 303
 00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:40,236
 That's not how it happened.
 -Who cares...
 
 304
 00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:43,739
 ...as long as it's our competitors
 who believe it and not the police?
 
 305
 00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:47,243
 Oh, my-
 -No, don't you see how great this is?
 
 306
 00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:51,539
 Look, you-You are a...
 
 307
 00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,544
 Jesse, look at me.
 
 308
 00:24:57,211 --> 00:25:00,339
 You are a blowfish.
 
 309
 00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:02,758
 What?
 -A blowfish. Think about it.
 
 310
 00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:07,096
 Small in stature,
 not swift, not cunning.
 
 311
 00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:08,597
 Easy prey for predators...
 
 312
 00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,100
 ...but the blowfish
 has a secret weapon...
 
 313
 00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:13,644
 ...doesn't he? Doesn't he?
 
 314
 00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:17,773
 What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
 What does the blowfish do?
 
 315
 00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:22,611
 I don't even know-
 -The blowfish puffs up.
 
 316
 00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,657
 The blowfish puffs himself up
 four, five times larger than normal.
 
 317
 00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:29,452
 And why? Why does he do that?
 
 318
 00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,330
 So that it makes him intimidating,
 that's why.
 
 319
 00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:33,539
 Intimidating.
 
 320
 00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:36,959
 So that the other scarier fish
 are scared off.
 
 321
 00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,920
 And that's you. You are a blowfish.
 
 322
 00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:43,090
 You see, it's just all an illusion.
 
 323
 00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,302
 You see, it's nothing but air.
 
 324
 00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,305
 Now...
 
 325
 00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:52,641
 ...who messes with the blowfish,
 Jesse?
 
 326
 00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:56,270
 Nobody.
 -You're damn right.
 
 327
 00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:00,524
 I'm a blowfish.
 -You are a blowfish.
 
 328
 00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,234
 Say it again.
 -I'm a blowfish.
 
 329
 00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:04,320
 Say it like you mean it.
 -I'm a blowfish.
 
 330
 00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:07,406
 You're a blowfish. That's right.
 -Yeah!
 
 331
 00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,493
 Blowfishing this up.
 
 332
 00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,532
 Hello?
 
 333
 00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,660
 <i>The SkyMall.
 Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>
 
 334
 00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,834
 Vanco...
 
 335
 00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:03,587
 ...new guy don't speak Spanish.
 What's up?
 
 336
 00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:08,467
 Hey, white boy,
 better learn Español, huh?
 
 337
 00:27:08,676 --> 00:27:11,971
 This ain't Branson, Missouri,
 know what I'm talking about?
 
 338
 00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:15,683
 You know what? I'll teach you.
 
 339
 00:27:19,395 --> 00:27:22,732
 It means, "Let's make a deal."
 
 340
 00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,234
 So go ahead. We're waiting.
 
 341
 00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,529
 Okay.
 
 342
 00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:32,074
 Right here.
 
 343
 00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,994
 "Item SS4G:
 
 344
 00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:39,749
 Yankee Stadium final season
 commemorative baseball...
 
 345
 00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,751
 ...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."
 
 346
 00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,545
 Vanco, write this down.
 
 347
 00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,131
 Oh, man, watch out.
 
 348
 00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:52,595
 "66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."
 
 349
 00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:56,015
 Look at that, huh?
 It's a rug you put on the floor...
 
 350
 00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:59,101
 ...except for it looks like
 a hundred-dollar bill.
 
 351
 00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,564
 <i>I love them. Get me 20 of them.
 I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>
 
 352
 00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:04,940
 We'll get you three.
 
 353
 00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:07,193
 No, you give me 10.
 -Five.
 
 354
 00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,573
 Hey. How about you stop
 jerking us off here?
 
 355
 00:28:16,827 --> 00:28:19,914
 Where's the meet?
 When's it going down?
 
 356
 00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,626
 White boy don't like
 let's make a deal, huh?
 
 357
 00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,629
 White boy's gonna kick your ass,
 you don't stop wasting time.
 
 358
 00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:27,880
 Schrader...
 
 359
 00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:34,553
 Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
 You know what that means?
 
 360
 00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:39,225
 Well, if I had to guess,
 I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."
 
 361
 00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:44,021
 Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.
 
 362
 00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:51,153
 I take my time, but I always win.
 
 363
 00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,409
 Oh, wait. That reminds me.
 
 364
 00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:59,120
 I seen this earlier. Lookit.
 
 365
 00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:03,249
 This is awesome, homes.
 Right there, look at that.
 
 366
 00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:06,544
 "The tranquil tortoise
 garden sculpture."
 
 367
 00:29:06,752 --> 00:29:08,421
 Definitely two of those, huh?
 
 368
 00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:12,174
 Check it out, huh? Good likeness.
 
 369
 00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,053
 Hank's doing great down there.
 He's making inroads.
 
 370
 00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:18,806
 I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.
 
 371
 00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:22,101
 So you gonna go down to EI Paso?
 
 372
 00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:24,770
 Please. It's Third World enough
 around here.
 
 373
 00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:26,564
 They keep him busy every second.
 
 374
 00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,774
 He's already got some
 big operation going.
 
 375
 00:29:28,983 --> 00:29:31,360
 Some hush-hush deal
 he couldn't tell me about...
 
 376
 00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,904
 ...except it's on the other side
 of the border.
 
 377
 00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:35,698
 Wow, that sounds exciting.
 
 378
 00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,451
 He's being safe, right?
 
 379
 00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,745
 Yeah.
 He says he's mostly riding a desk.
 
 380
 00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,956
 Which, between you and me,
 is just the way I want it.
 
 381
 00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:47,543
 Speaking of riding desks...
 
 382
 00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:49,712
 ...got myself a job today.
 
 383
 00:29:51,547 --> 00:29:52,548
 You did not.
 
 384
 00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:57,845
 As big as you are?
 
 385
 00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,559
 Thank you.
 -You know I just mean...
 
 386
 00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,394
 Where? With who?
 
 387
 00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:09,315
 Well, someone willing
 to work around that, apparently.
 
 388
 00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:10,524
 Beneke.
 
 389
 00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:14,403
 You did not.
 Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?
 
 390
 00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,739
 Marie, that was one time
 at a Christmas party.
 
 391
 00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:21,911
 And he was so drunk,
 he was practically slurring his words.
 
 392
 00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:25,456
 Just what you want in an executive.
 -And he apologised profusely.
 
 393
 00:30:25,665 --> 00:30:29,251
 Plus he's married with a family.
 I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.
 
 394
 00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,171
 It will not happen again.
 
 395
 00:30:34,256 --> 00:30:36,717
 Is money that tight?
 
 396
 00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,263
 Yeah.
 
 397
 00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:44,475
 You know we can always help out.
 
 398
 00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,144
 No, Marie.
 
 399
 00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:49,021
 You know Walt. He would just...
 
 400
 00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,861
 Speak of the devil.
 -Hey. Hi, Marie.
 
 401
 00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,780
 How are you? What's up?
 
 402
 00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:00,741
 Nothing much.
 How's things with you?
 
 403
 00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,618
 Good. Good.
 -Hi, honey.
 
 404
 00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,454
 Dinner will be about an hour and-
 -Oh, thanks, sweetie.
 
 405
 00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,333
 Everything okay?
 -Everything's perfect.
 
 406
 00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:35,317
 This is Raisin Bran,
 not Raisin Bran Crunch.
 
 407
 00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,528
 So? Same thing.
 
 408
 00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,280
 Not the same thing.
 
 409
 00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:42,283
 I'll tell you what, why don't you
 do the grocery shopping?
 
 410
 00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:46,746
 And then you can get
 whatever you want. Great.
 
 411
 00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:52,043
 It's-It's not that hard, Mom.
 It says "crunch" on the box.
 
 412
 00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,461
 You're pushing it.
 
 413
 00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,422
 Morning.
 -Morning, honey.
 
 414
 00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,674
 Hey, Dad.
 -Hey.
 
 415
 00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,969
 Dad, notice anything?
 
 416
 00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:05,639
 Is there a funeral today?
 
 417
 00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:06,849
 A funeral?
 -Well-
 
 418
 00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,185
 Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
 -No, no, no.
 
 419
 00:32:09,393 --> 00:32:11,479
 Mom got a job.
 
 420
 00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:13,105
 A job? Why?
 
 421
 00:32:13,314 --> 00:32:15,858
 Well, do I need to get out
 the chequebook and show you?
 
 422
 00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,195
 No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
 in your condition?
 
 423
 00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:22,114
 No, no. The doctor said I can work
 up until I go into labour.
 
 424
 00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:25,701
 And it's just an office job.
 I'm just sitting on my butt.
 
 425
 00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,579
 Where?
 
 426
 00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,998
 Beneke.
 
 427
 00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,793
 I'm back working
 in the Accounting Department.
 
 428
 00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:37,672
 Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
 Isn't that why you had to quit...
 
 429
 00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,883
 ...in the first place?
 -They've gone green since then.
 
 430
 00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,762
 They have some kind of
 green welding or something.
 
 431
 00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,723
 I didn't smell anything
 when I was in there.
 
 432
 00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,811
 Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?
 
 433
 00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,145
 Yeah.
 
 434
 00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:54,397
 Who's running things?
 
 435
 00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,857
 Ted. The son.
 
 436
 00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:02,405
 Anyway, I have got to go.
 
 437
 00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,200
 I don't wanna be late
 my first day back.
 
 438
 00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,160
 Bye-bye.
 -Bye.
 
 439
 00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,162
 Bye.
 -Bye.
 
 440
 00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,789
 Okay.
 
 441
 00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:15,376
 Wish me luck.
 -Good luck.
 
 442
 00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:19,755
 Bye.
 
 443
 00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,144
 Hey.
 
 444
 00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:36,731
 You left your cave.
 
 445
 00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:38,941
 Yeah.
 
 446
 00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,777
 I was-I'm missing my TV.
 
 447
 00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,362
 Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.
 
 448
 00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:46,115
 You know,
 snag a big-ass wide-screen.
 
 449
 00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:48,576
 So...
 
 450
 00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,494
 Yeah.
 
 451
 00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,830
 What you drawing?
 
 452
 00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,751
 Damn.
 
 453
 00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,336
 That's good.
 
 454
 00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:00,212
 Make a hell of a tat.
 
 455
 00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:01,547
 That's the plan.
 
 456
 00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:02,923
 Really?
 
 457
 00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:05,968
 I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.
 
 458
 00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,261
 Right on.
 
 459
 00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:11,974
 Yo, you're a real good drawer.
 
 460
 00:34:12,558 --> 00:34:14,769
 I used to do a little of that.
 
 461
 00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:19,357
 You used to be a drawer too, huh?
 
 462
 00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:23,986
 What stopped you?
 
 463
 00:34:27,406 --> 00:34:29,325
 You know, just...
 
 464
 00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:31,452
 So tell me something.
 
 465
 00:34:31,661 --> 00:34:36,040
 What kind of tattoo artist
 has no tattoos?
 
 466
 00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:40,169
 That's way too big a commitment.
 
 467
 00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:52,598
 Hey, man. You're Pinkman.
 
 468
 00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,186
 You're the man!
 Everybody's been talking about you.
 
 469
 00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,854
 Yeah.
 
 470
 00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:01,440
 Right on, man. Keep it real.
 
 471
 00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,074
 "Pinkman," huh?
 
 472
 00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,701
 Yeah.
 
 473
 00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,161
 I thought your name was "Jackson."
 
 474
 00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,555
 Well, your snitch
 is really earning his nickname.
 
 475
 00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:34,015
 Are we...?
 
 476
 00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:35,725
 Are we just on mañana time?
 
 477
 00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,268
 They'll show.
 
 478
 00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,229
 Yeah? Why is that?
 
 479
 00:35:40,479 --> 00:35:43,357
 You got more catalogues
 for him to clean out?
 
 480
 00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:47,236
 Maybe a little Sharper Image
 or Pottery Barn?
 
 481
 00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:53,159
 What the hell are they thinking?
 
 482
 00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,870
 Sending us some loudmouth
 who doesn't speak the language?
 
 483
 00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,289
 Politics, man. Politics.
 
 484
 00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:05,254
 Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
 I say it's a bunch of crap.
 
 485
 00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,760
 Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
 Maybe it don't take much up there.
 
 486
 00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,722
 Hey, something
 I need to know about?
 
 487
 00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,308
 What? Oh, that? No, man.
 
 488
 00:36:17,516 --> 00:36:20,478
 We were just singing your praises.
 
 489
 00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,979
 Glad to have you.
 
 490
 00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:23,939
 Welcome aboard.
 
 491
 00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,045
 Hey, is that your guy?
 
 492
 00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,882
 Hey, I think that's your guy.
 
 493
 00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,302
 What the hell
 is he doing down there?
 
 494
 00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,954
 Schrader, where you going?
 
 495
 00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:06,876
 We need an evidence bag, right?
 A pretty big one.
 
 496
 00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,047
 What's the matter?
 You act like you never saw...
 
 497
 00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,549
 ...a severed human head
 on a tortoise before.
 
 498
 00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,563
 Hey, welcome to-
 
 499
 00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:54,715
 My leg.
 
 500
 00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:18,489
 <i>-headed by Werner Heisenberg,
 were also undertaken during the war.</i>
 
 501
 00:39:18,698 --> 00:39:21,117
 The game has changed, yo.
 
 502
 00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,120
 This is our city, all right?
 
 503
 00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,872
 All of it. The whole damn place.
 
 504
 00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,125
 Our territory.
 
 505
 00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,127
 We're staking our claim...
 
 506
 00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:35,089
 ...that we sell when we want,
 where we want.
 
 507
 00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:38,050
 Now, we're gonna be kings,
 understand?
 
 508
 00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,802
 Well, I'm gonna be king.
 
 509
 00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,471
 You guys will be princes
 or dukes or something.
 
 510
 00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,307
 I wanna be a knight.
 -But first things first.
 
 511
 00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,601
 We gotta get more dealers.
 
 512
 00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,312
 You know, foot soldiers, right?
 
 513
 00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,314
 Now, they'll be working for you.
 
 514
 00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,609
 You're working for me,
 and they're working for you.
 
 515
 00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,903
 You follow me?
 
 516
 00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,905
 Layered, like nachos.
 
 517
 00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:01,824
 Exponential growth.
 
 518
 00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,619
 Now, that's success
 with a capital S.
 
 519
 00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,371
 Straight up, straight up.
 
 520
 00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,581
 For shizzle.
 
 521
 00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:09,832
 Frigging awesome.
 
 522
 00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,387
 Well, we're set.
 
 523
 00:40:23,596 --> 00:40:27,099
 Our boys are ready.
 Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.
 
 524
 00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,393
 Cheddar, Mr. White.
 
 525
 00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:33,814
 Fat stacks, dead presidents,
 cash money.
 
 526
 00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,109
 Gonna own this city.
 
 527
 00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,362
 We're not charging enough.
 
 528
 00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:41,989
 What?
 
 529
 00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:45,326
 You corner the market,
 then raise the price.
 
 530
 00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:48,162
 Simple economics.
 
 531
 00:41:08,683 --> 00:41:11,060
 Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.
 
 532
 00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,188
 Looks like they got you all set up.
 -Yeah. It's perfect.
 
 533
 00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:17,400
 I am close enough to the bathroom
 that I don't have to waddle far.
 
 534
 00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,609
 And that's very nice.
 
 535
 00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:21,070
 I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
 -Yeah.
 
 536
 00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,990
 Listen, I...
 
 537
 00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:28,202
 I wanted to thank you
 for having me back.
 
 538
 00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,247
 You don't have to thank me.
 I need you.
 
 539
 00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:38,587
 Wow, Ted, it's a little early
 for wine, isn't it?
 
 540
 00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,423
 Oh, damn. It's grape juice.
 
 541
 00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,925
 Been making the girls
 breakfast in the morning.
 
 542
 00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,593
 Hey, how is Denise doing?
 
 543
 00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,596
 We split up, about a year ago.
 
 544
 00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:51,100
 I'm sorry.
 
 545
 00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,645
 She's definitely happier now.
 I guess I am too, most days.
 
 546
 00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:57,440
 Together since high school.
 -Yeah.
 
 547
 00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:59,608
 I remember that.
 -Anyway...
 
 548
 00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,695
 I don't know, people change.
 
 549
 00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:03,988
 Yes.
 
 550
 00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:06,782
 Anyway, I just wanted
 to welcome you.
 
 551
 00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,493
 Welcome you back. And...
 
 552
 00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:12,204
 I'll see you around
 the vending machines.
 
 553
 00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:13,914
 Okay.
 
 554
 00:42:17,418 --> 00:42:19,003
 We should have lunch one day.
 
 555
 00:42:19,211 --> 00:42:20,463
 Like old times.
 
 556
 00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,798
 Sure.
 
 557
 00:43:55,474 --> 00:43:57,226
 Oh, hey.
 
 558
 00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,770
 Hey, yourself.
 
 559
 00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,736
 So listen. My...
 
 560
 00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:09,989
 My name is not really
 Jesse Jackson.
 
 561
 00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,827
 It's Jesse Pinkman.
 
 562
 00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,913
 And that guy you met...
 
 563
 00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:22,835
 ...he's not my dad.
 
 564
 00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:35,556
 You're not gonna kick me out,
 are you?
 
 565
 00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:38,601
 Because I actually really like it here.
 
 566
 00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:42,897
 I don't make it my business
 what you do.
 
 567
 00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:46,025
 So long as you don't do it here.
 
 568
 00:44:52,615 --> 00:44:56,577
 So, hey, I got this kick-ass
 new flat-screen.
 
 569
 00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,083
 Wanna see?
 
 570
 00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,821
 It's got that thing where the blacks...
 
 571
 00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,158
 ...are, like, you know,
 really, really, really black.
 
 572
 00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:41,706
 And the Dolby six-point-whatever.
 
 573
 00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:46,043
 So it'll really rock the house.
 
 574
 00:45:47,003 --> 00:45:48,713
 But I'll, you know...
 
 575
 00:45:48,921 --> 00:45:54,176
 I'll keep it way down, of course.
 
 576
 00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,356
 I don't know what the hell
 is taking so long.
 
 577
 00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,529
 Come on, come on.</nowiki>
