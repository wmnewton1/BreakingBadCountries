 ​1
 00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,673
 I am awake.
 
 2
 00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,113
 You are not how I remember you
 from class. I mean, like, not at all.
 
 3
 00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,629
 Dude, this isn't even 7 grand, all right?
 My guy wants 85.
 
 4
 00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,033
 This is all the money I have
 in the world.
 
 5
 00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,431
 You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.
 
 6
 00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,634
 Buy the RV.
 
 7
 00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,956
 We start tomorrow.
 
 8
 00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,429
 Work it, work it, baby.
 Yo, this is sick, brother.
 
 9
 00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,113
 Totally. God.
 
 10
 00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,035
 Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
 who wanna participate.
 
 11
 00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,272
 - You got the funds?
 - Oh, I got the funds. Hey.
 
 12
 00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,795
 Would you ladies like to meet
 my fat stack?
 
 13
 00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,155
 Get in here.
 
 14
 00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,076
 Come on.
 
 15
 00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,915
 Hey, yo, yo.
 
 16
 00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,038
 Yo, you got champagne?
 None of that cheap stuff.
 
 17
 00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,919
 I want the... expensive shit.
 Don Pérignon.
 
 18
 00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,399
 It's 400 a bottle.
 
 19
 00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,916
 Oh, well, in that case,
 I'll only have two.
 
 20
 00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,154
 Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
 I like those skinny glasses.
 
 21
 00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,711
 That's what James Bond drinks.
 Mofos, I'm all about that.
 
 22
 00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,555
 Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.
 
 23
 00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,679
 - Where did you get all the cheddar?
 - Must be moving mad volume.
 
 24
 00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,751
 It's funny.
 You wanna know what's funny?
 
 25
 00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,514
 - What's funny?
 - This old dude, he gave it to me.
 
 26
 00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,829
 - What?
 - He gave it to me.
 
 27
 00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,513
 It's his entire life savings.
 
 28
 00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,355
 - What? Why?
 - Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.
 
 29
 00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,919
 Oh, God.
 
 30
 00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,639
 Yes!
 
 31
 00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,314
 All right, living large, players.
 
 32
 00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,469
 Thank you. Yo, thank you.
 
 33
 00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,275
 - Thank you.
 - That was...
 
 34
 00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,835
 Awesome, bro.
 
 35
 00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,238
 Later.
 
 36
 00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,479
 Oh, man.
 
 37
 00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,915
 Oh, I'm so dead.
 
 38
 00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,516
 I only got... Oh, damn.
 
 39
 00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,152
 I only got, like, 1400.
 
 40
 00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,676
 Waffle House? Yeah.
 
 41
 00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,671
 No, man.
 
 42
 00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,879
 Supposed to use that dude's money
 to buy an RV.
 
 43
 00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,912
 - What do you want with a RV for?
 - Because, like...
 
 44
 00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,072
 Because, like...
 
 45
 00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,638
 Never mind.
 
 46
 00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,994
 Jesus.
 
 47
 00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,598
 Now I gotta, like, leave town
 or change my identity or something.
 
 48
 00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,194
 Guy's blackmailing me.
 
 49
 00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,751
 He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.
 
 50
 00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,831
 RV, yeah?
 
 51
 00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,876
 I can hook you up, bro.
 I can totally get you an RV.
 
 52
 00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,194
 - No, I need it today. Now.
 - No problem. Let's go.
 
 53
 00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,679
 You're telling me
 you can get me an RV?
 
 54
 00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,831
 For 1400, at 6 in the morning?
 
 55
 00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,912
 Right on.
 
 56
 00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,833
 So do I need to sign something?
 
 57
 00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,356
 No, it's, like,
 a no-paperwork-type deal.
 
 58
 00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,714
 Pleasure doing business with you.
 
 59
 00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,952
 Come on, we gotta bounce.
 
 60
 00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
 - What?
 - For real, yo. Get it out of here.
 
 61
 00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,557
 Oh, my God, I love this floor.
 
 62
 00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,878
 This feels fantastic.
 
 63
 00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,474
 Can you control the temperature?
 
 64
 00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,155
 Yeah. There should be a switch
 right next to you there.
 
 65
 00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,515
 It's a thermostat.
 
 66
 00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,311
 Ted, this has gotta be...
 
 67
 00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,553
 ...the most amazing invention ever.
 
 68
 00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,678
 I know. Contractor talked me into it.
 
 69
 00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,799
 Seemed kind of extravagant, but...
 
 70
 00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,430
 I gotta tell you, once you try it,
 you can't go back.
 
 71
 00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,269
 I can never find anything
 in this Buick.
 
 72
 00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,069
 You know, you could leave
 a few things here if you want.
 
 73
 00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,239
 - Why don't you go get your dad?
 - Sure.
 
 74
 00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,231
 Hey, Dad.
 
 75
 00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,310
 - Dad?
 - Yeah.
 
 76
 00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,953
 Mom's asking.
 
 77
 00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,076
 Wanna come to dinner?
 
 78
 00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,879
 Yeah, I'll be right there.
 
 79
 00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,750
 You're not listening to me.
 I don't know.
 
 80
 00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,990
 ''Yeah, right, lik e you don't know.''
 
 81
 00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,435
 - What did I just say?
 - Give me the phone. Give it.
 
 82
 00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,672
 Like you didn't make some deal
 behind my back.
 
 83
 00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,558
 ''Correct. I did not.''
 
 84
 00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,472
 I was sitting at a stoplight...
 
 85
 00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,552
 ...minding my own business,
 when the man... The man...
 
 86
 00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,712
 The kid threw a bag of money
 through my window.
 
 87
 00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,791
 Whatever, man.
 You owe me that money.
 
 88
 00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,678
 - Let me talk to him.
 ''- I owe you?''
 
 89
 00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,671
 I owe you nothing.
 
 90
 00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,990
 And I will get to the bottom of this.
 Trust me.
 
 91
 00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,071
 Trust you? Trust you?
 That's a good one.
 
 92
 00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,719
 Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
 
 93
 00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,633
 You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
 Let's talk about trust.
 
 94
 00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,315
 I told you not to cook my formula,
 and you went ahead and did it anyway.
 
 95
 00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,870
 Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
 because it ain't yours. It's ours.
 
 96
 00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,075
 Plural, bitch.
 
 97
 00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,958
 You did not have my permission.
 
 98
 00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
 All I know is I got half the money
 I'm due...
 
 99
 00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,273
 ...and you got the rest.
 
 100
 00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,998
 Escalating. You're... escalating.
 
 101
 00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,675
 You know what? Escalate this.
 My meth, my money!
 
 102
 00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,914
 ''I will be a one-man glass factory.''
 ''I will rock that RV 24...''
 
 103
 00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,273
 It's buttoned up tight.
 Can't see a damn thing.
 
 104
 00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,112
 I ain't feeling it.
 
 105
 00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,549
 No smoke, no smell, no waste.
 There's no cook.
 
 106
 00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,633
 Could be they're setting up.
 I heard movement inside.
 
 107
 00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,792
 I say we call it a night,
 come back with a search warrant.
 
 108
 00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,554
 I'm not letting this sucker
 out of my sight.
 
 109
 00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,036
 There's gotta be a way.
 
 110
 00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,910
 There's gotta be a way.
 There's gotta be a way...
 
 111
 00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,596
 Hey, hey, hey.
 
 112
 00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,912
 What are you doing?
 
 113
 00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,551
 - No, no, no.
 - What the hell are you doing up there?
 
 114
 00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,314
 Are you some kind of a pe... rt?
 
 115
 00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,309
 Yeah,
 because we were here last year.
 
 116
 00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
 Sorry. I appreciate...
 
 117
 00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,271
 Going after the bad guys.
 
 118
 00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,150
 I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
 of your vacation. Okay?
 
 119
 00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,154
 Go back to your trailers.
 Everything's okay.
 
 120
 00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,951
 Guy's VFW. He's cool.
 
 121
 00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,793
 We're gonna check out a couple more
 and call it a morning.
 
 122
 00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,428
 - Okay, what do you say?
 - Can't. Gotta get home.
 
 123
 00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,637
 Why, you leave your balls
 in your wife's purse or what?
 
 124
 00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,558
 Gotta pack.
 
 125
 00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,634
 Where you headed?
 
 126
 00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,158
 Texas.
 
 127
 00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,549
 Hey there.
 
 128
 00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,353
 Hank?
 
 129
 00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,232
 Hank?
 
 130
 00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,632
 Can I come in?
 
 131
 00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,588
 - Hey, babe.
 - Hey.
 
 132
 00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,795
 - How did it go last night?
 - Good.
 
 133
 00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,871
 Catch the bad guys?
 
 134
 00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,513
 Nope.
 
 135
 00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,793
 - Want me to make you some breakfast?
 - No. I'm...
 
 136
 00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
 I'm heading back out after this.
 
 137
 00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,672
 Now? You worked all night.
 
 138
 00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,479
 Get some sleep, Hank.
 Those RVs aren't going anywhere.
 
 139
 00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,235
 They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
 That's what they do.
 
 140
 00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,152
 You know what I mean.
 
 141
 00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,991
 I spoke with Blanca.
 
 142
 00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,756
 She said
 that Steven's going to El Paso?
 
 143
 00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,839
 Yeah.
 
 144
 00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,196
 I was just wondering
 how you feel about that.
 
 145
 00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,475
 - I turned it down. End of story.
 - Good. Good.
 
 146
 00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,232
 Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.
 
 147
 00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,551
 I needed some time here because
 I'm deep into this investigation...
 
 148
 00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,075
 ...and couldn't do both...
 
 149
 00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,435
 ...so I made a judgement call.
 
 150
 00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,951
 You know that you can talk to me
 about things, right?
 
 151
 00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,634
 You don't have
 to go through this alone.
 
 152
 00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,069
 Do you ask me which lead bib
 to put on someone...
 
 153
 00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,832
 ...before you nuke them?
 
 154
 00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,399
 Jesus, Marie.
 
 155
 00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,870
 I made a decision.
 I'm not going through anything.
 
 156
 00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,031
 Doing my job.
 
 157
 00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,512
 - I would like...
 - I know. I know.
 
 158
 00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,238
 A condo in Georgetown. I know.
 
 159
 00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,995
 If you would let me finish,
 I was going to say...
 
 160
 00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,153
 ...I'd like to be included. That's all.
 
 161
 00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,199
 Don't you worry about my career.
 My career is just fine.
 
 162
 00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,069
 Did you not wanna go?
 
 163
 00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,992
 I don't blame you. I just...
 
 164
 00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,311
 - Aren't you late for work or something?
 - After what happened...
 
 165
 00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,278
 ...it would make perfect sense
 for you to not wanna go back.
 
 166
 00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,829
 I'm onto some important stuff
 right here, right now.
 
 167
 00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,834
 And Mexico doesn't have a damn thing
 to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...
 
 168
 00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,070
 I mean, I'm doing
 some actual good out here...
 
 169
 00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,312
 ...and all I get
 are these bullshit accusations!
 
 170
 00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,358
 What, everyone thinks
 I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.
 
 171
 00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,192
 But I'm onto something. I know it.
 
 172
 00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,396
 You understand me?
 
 173
 00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,832
 You hear me?
 
 174
 00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,079
 What exactly is this?
 
 175
 00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,189
 I'll tell you what I think it is.
 
 176
 00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,349
 A ploy.
 A ploy to get me cooking again.
 
 177
 00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,033
 And an obvious one at that.
 
 178
 00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,077
 How do you mean?
 
 179
 00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,555
 As if I would seriously believe
 you would hire an addict.
 
 180
 00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,075
 Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.
 
 181
 00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,232
 You vouched for him previously.
 I took you at your word.
 
 182
 00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,996
 No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
 Let me be perfectly clear.
 
 183
 00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,994
 Jesse was capable of working
 under my supervision.
 
 184
 00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,353
 Trusting him with a solo venture...
 
 185
 00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,717
 ...well, that's quite another matter.
 
 186
 00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,151
 How he could possibly
 produce anything...
 
 187
 00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,198
 ...other than a mediocre product
 at best.
 
 188
 00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,716
 I am told his product
 was more or less consistent...
 
 189
 00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,474
 ...with the quality I had come to expect.
 
 190
 00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,949
 More or less?
 
 191
 00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,437
 More or less? Really?
 
 192
 00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,314
 Boy, that is the...
 Talk about setting the bar low.
 
 193
 00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,957
 Except you don't do that,
 set the bar low.
 
 194
 00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,235
 Therefore,
 what conclusion am I left to draw?
 
 195
 00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,512
 That you believe I have some
 proprietary kind of selfishness...
 
 196
 00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,750
 ...about my own formula.
 
 197
 00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,199
 Some sort of overweening pride,
 I suppose...
 
 198
 00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,956
 ...that you think
 simply overwhelms me...
 
 199
 00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,759
 ...clouds my judgement.
 
 200
 00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,390
 - But it doesn't.
 - Absolutely not.
 
 201
 00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,268
 I simply respect the chemistry.
 
 202
 00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,797
 The chemistry must be respected.
 
 203
 00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,553
 I apologise for being so transparent.
 
 204
 00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,719
 Would you take a drive with me?
 I'd like to show you something.
 
 205
 00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,998
 Hi. Is everything okay?
 
 206
 00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,436
 She's already finished an entire bottle,
 but she still seemed hungry.
 
 207
 00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,033
 Then she fell asleep.
 
 208
 00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,998
 But I was thinking I'd give her another
 when she wakes up.
 
 209
 00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,116
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
 
 210
 00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,590
 - Fatten that baby up.
 ''- Will do.''
 
 211
 00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,869
 Was that it?
 
 212
 00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,112
 So where are you? Are you at work?
 
 213
 00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,670
 ''Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.''
 ''I shouldn't be much longer.''
 
 214
 00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,230
 ''- Is that okay?''
 - You know I love my little pookums.
 
 215
 00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,675
 You can leave her with me
 for the next 18 years...
 
 216
 00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,751
 ...as far as I'm concerned.
 
 217
 00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,469
 Great. Thanks, Marie.
 
 218
 00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,875
 Are you sure you're okay?
 
 219
 00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,789
 ''Sweetie, what is it? Come on.''
 
 220
 00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,953
 - It's Hank.
 ''- Hank? What about him?''
 
 221
 00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,114
 I don't know how to talk to him.
 
 222
 00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,875
 I don't know what to say to him
 anymore. I don't know how to...
 
 223
 00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,989
 Ever since El Paso, ever since...
 Maybe before...
 
 224
 00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,597
 Yeah. God knows
 he went through a lot down there.
 
 225
 00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,958
 People blown up right in front of him,
 blood everywhere...
 
 226
 00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,238
 ...and last week,
 El Paso said they want him back.
 
 227
 00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,389
 ''Yeah?''
 
 228
 00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,235
 He's not going. Steve Gomez
 is going in his place...
 
 229
 00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,352
 ...and I don't know
 how I feel about that.
 
 230
 00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,555
 Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
 isn't he?
 
 231
 00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,349
 ''Of course, and I want him safe.''
 
 232
 00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,593
 But I can't tell what he wants.
 He won't talk to me.
 
 233
 00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,554
 He hardly even comes home.
 He works all day, all night.
 
 234
 00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
 Barely eats, barely speaks to me.
 
 235
 00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,318
 ''It's lik e something's''
 ''eating him away from inside.''
 
 236
 00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,234
 He's just not the same. He's not.
 
 237
 00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,713
 Facing death, it changes a person.
 It has to, don't you think?
 
 238
 00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,669
 I guess you've noticed
 a change in Walt.
 
 239
 00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,558
 Please.
 
 240
 00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,472
 What is this?
 
 241
 00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,797
 Your new lab.
 
 242
 00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,749
 My God.
 
 243
 00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,955
 Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.
 
 244
 00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,477
 Look at the size
 of this reaction vessel.
 
 245
 00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,633
 Oh, it's got...
 It's gotta be 1200 litres.
 
 246
 00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,789
 Where...? Where...?
 
 247
 00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,999
 How did you know
 how to put this all together?
 
 248
 00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,755
 I had excellent help, as will you.
 
 249
 00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,069
 Quite a lot of planning went into this.
 
 250
 00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,517
 I would say so.
 
 251
 00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,398
 The laundry upstairs,
 I've owned it for years.
 
 252
 00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,393
 It receives large chemical deliveries
 on a weekly basis...
 
 253
 00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,834
 ...detergents and such.
 
 254
 00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,833
 There is nothing suspicious
 about it...
 
 255
 00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,755
 ...and my employees, to be sure,
 are well-trained, trustworthy.
 
 256
 00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,235
 The filtration system
 is state of the art.
 
 257
 00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,551
 It will vent nothing
 but clean, odourless steam...
 
 258
 00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,438
 ...just as the laundry does...
 
 259
 00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,353
 ...and through the very same stacks.
 
 260
 00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,950
 I need 200 pounds per week
 to make this economically viable.
 
 261
 00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,390
 You would choose your own hours,
 of course...
 
 262
 00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,596
 ...come and go as you please...
 
 263
 00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,116
 ...so long as the quota is met.
 
 264
 00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,638
 Sorry.
 
 265
 00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,555
 The answer is still no.
 
 266
 00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,748
 I have made a series
 of very bad decisions...
 
 267
 00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,195
 ...and I cannot make another one.
 
 268
 00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,191
 Why did you make these decisions?
 
 269
 00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,676
 For the good of my family.
 
 270
 00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,471
 Then they weren't bad decisions.
 
 271
 00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,555
 What does a man do, Walter?
 
 272
 00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,197
 A man provides for his family.
 
 273
 00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,074
 This cost me my family.
 
 274
 00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,795
 When you have children,
 you always have family.
 
 275
 00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,191
 They will always be your priority,
 your responsibility.
 
 276
 00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,831
 And a man... A man provides.
 
 277
 00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,396
 And he does it
 even when he's not appreciated...
 
 278
 00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,069
 ...or respected...
 
 279
 00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,311
 ...or even loved.
 
 280
 00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,951
 He simply bears up, and he does it...
 
 281
 00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,470
 ...because he's a man.
 
 282
 00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,716
 Any chance
 we could grab a quick bite?
 
 283
 00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,390
 Thai place around the corner's
 pretty good.
 
 284
 00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,996
 I really gotta head home.
 
 285
 00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,079
 All right, rain check, then.
 
 286
 00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,314
 She said it was the tofu.
 
 287
 00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,390
 Whatever. She's still cute anyways.
 
 288
 00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,549
 Great dinner, Mom.
 
 289
 00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,954
 Can I be... excused?
 
 290
 00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,629
 To do homework
 or to play video games?
 
 291
 00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,358
 I can multitask.
 
 292
 00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,594
 Yeah.
 
 293
 00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,431
 You wanna take her?
 
 294
 00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,792
 Yeah.
 
 295
 00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,190
 Give me something, Andy. Come on.
 
 296
 00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,836
 Welded onto the back of a house.
 Well, that's classy.
 
 297
 00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,238
 Christ.
 
 298
 00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,993
 Okay. Okay, thanks.
 
 299
 00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,279
 Hey, Janice. Janice.
 
 300
 00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,629
 That the last one?
 
 301
 00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,552
 Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.
 
 302
 00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,554
 Twenty nine... early '80s Bounders
 registered in New Mexico.
 
 303
 00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,509
 - Could you check again?
 - Now?
 
 304
 00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,429
 - Can I do it after the party?
 - Janice, I'm...
 
 305
 00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,999
 I'm dead in the water here.
 
 306
 00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,074
 Okay, I'll check.
 
 307
 00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,071
 Hey, how are you guys doing?
 
 308
 00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,353
 Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
 really good, I tell you.
 
 309
 00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,033
 All good.
 
 310
 00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,191
 - Gomey.
 - Yeah.
 
 311
 00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,352
 Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
 huh?
 
 312
 00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,949
 The right guy for the job since
 the bean-speak comes natural and all.
 
 313
 00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,237
 Wanna know how to say
 "get bent" in Spanish?
 
 314
 00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,875
 Just don't go native on me, all right?
 
 315
 00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,952
 Hey.
 
 316
 00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,717
 Here.
 
 317
 00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,796
 Know your enemy and all.
 
 318
 00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,674
 - Fight the good fight, brother.
 - I will.
 
 319
 00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,709
 Who got a drink around here?
 
 320
 00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,228
 Your hunch was right. One more RV.
 
 321
 00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,516
 DMV said the registration
 wasn't renewed...
 
 322
 00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,593
 ...but then they realised it was never
 filed as non-operational or destroyed.
 
 323
 00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,035
 No police report, either.
 
 324
 00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,109
 I just don't know what the hell
 I'm doing anymore, you know?
 
 325
 00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,908
 It's like I'm paralyzed...
 
 326
 00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,355
 ...like if I take a step
 in any direction...
 
 327
 00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,150
 ...I'm gonna make
 a spectacular mistake.
 
 328
 00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,910
 God, I could go
 for a glass of wine about now.
 
 329
 00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,358
 You wanna go to...?
 
 330
 00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,915
 Sorry, never mind.
 
 331
 00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,512
 Anyway...
 
 332
 00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,029
 ...breaking news is
 I am sleeping with my boss...
 
 333
 00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,794
 ...and I don't know why.
 
 334
 00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,199
 Yep.
 
 335
 00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,876
 That's a lie. I do know why.
 
 336
 00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,476
 I mean, he's a lovely guy.
 
 337
 00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,996
 He's a really good person...
 
 338
 00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,118
 ...but, I mean,
 it's not like we're... ever gonna...
 
 339
 00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,712
 Somehow,
 and I can't actually believe it...
 
 340
 00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,715
 ...but my entire family
 sees me as some sort of...
 
 341
 00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,031
 My own sister, my brother-in-law.
 
 342
 00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,317
 My teenage son...
 
 343
 00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,556
 ...tells me I'm a bitch.
 
 344
 00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,197
 And you say tell him the truth.
 
 345
 00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,789
 Tell him about his father...
 
 346
 00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,598
 ...but I can't.
 
 347
 00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,799
 Ever.
 
 348
 00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,119
 How could I?
 
 349
 00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,589
 And this man that I'm seeing,
 you know...
 
 350
 00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,919
 ...as wrong as I know it is...
 
 351
 00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,152
 ...as much as I know I'm probably
 doing it to make Walt leave me...
 
 352
 00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,839
 ...it is the only thing in my day
 where I don't feel...
 
 353
 00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,275
 ...like I'm...
 
 354
 00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,598
 ...drowning.
 
 355
 00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,068
 So he knows about this other man?
 
 356
 00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,629
 Yeah.
 
 357
 00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,837
 So then he'll sign?
 
 358
 00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,955
 Walt says he's not going anywhere...
 
 359
 00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,398
 ...so that's a really brilliant
 gambit on my part. Yep.
 
 360
 00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,678
 Genius.
 
 361
 00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,553
 He keeps money in the house.
 
 362
 00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,149
 Your husband, the drug dealer?
 
 363
 00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,311
 How much money?
 
 364
 00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,629
 I didn't count it. It's heavy.
 
 365
 00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,550
 A bag, where he keeps it.
 
 366
 00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,548
 Are you asking my permission
 to spend this money?
 
 367
 00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,756
 No. God, no. I just...
 
 368
 00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,150
 No, I'm just, you know...
 
 369
 00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,630
 I'm just trying to just talk it through.
 That's...
 
 370
 00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,870
 Let me just say
 that I'm half as qualified...
 
 371
 00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,669
 ...and twice the price of a therapist.
 There is nothing to discuss here.
 
 372
 00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,674
 I'm just saying, you know?
 We have a history.
 
 373
 00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,636
 He's the father of my children...
 
 374
 00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,429
 ...and maybe what he did, he...
 
 375
 00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,670
 He did it for the family. Right?
 
 376
 00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,788
 Well, guess what.
 
 377
 00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,474
 That is one... enormous load
 of horse shit.
 
 378
 00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,914
 Okay.
 
 379
 00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,833
 I'm going to spell this out
 as simply as I can for you.
 
 380
 00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,910
 You are a fool to stay in that house
 one minute longer.
 
 381
 00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,310
 If your husband won't leave,
 then you go.
 
 382
 00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,630
 You are now an accessory
 after the fact.
 
 383
 00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,994
 You are culpable.
 
 384
 00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,038
 You, your children,
 you could lose... everything you own.
 
 385
 00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,077
 Do you understand?
 
 386
 00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,036
 All courtesy of this criminal
 you refuse to divorce.
 
 387
 00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,878
 - I didn't marry a criminal.
 - Well, you're married to one now.
 
 388
 00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,395
 How's about we run through this
 one more time...
 
 389
 00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,199
 ...especially where I do the talking,
 you don't say jack?
 
 390
 00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,238
 Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
 I'm gonna say plenty.
 
 391
 00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,517
 What did we say about escalating, huh?
 Who's got your back here?
 
 392
 00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,114
 Me, all right?
 I'm going to take care of things.
 
 393
 00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,477
 Hey, what are the parameters
 of this sobriety thing you got going?
 
 394
 00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,517
 - What do you mean?
 - Can you take a Xanax?
 
 395
 00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,796
 Because I got a drawer full of them.
 
 396
 00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,032
 I get them from my "chiropractor."
 
 397
 00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,876
 Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
 She adjusts you to "completion."
 
 398
 00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,632
 Her name's Kim Nu Suong...
 
 399
 00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,633
 ...as delicious as it sounds.
 
 400
 00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,075
 I should give you her card.
 
 401
 00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,557
 Hell with this. I'm out of here.
 
 402
 00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,392
 ''He's here.''
 
 403
 00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,718
 Send him in.
 
 404
 00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,712
 Hello, Walt. Good to see you.
 
 405
 00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,589
 Please, have a seat here.
 
 406
 00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,194
 Mr. Pinkman, if you will.
 
 407
 00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,479
 You're late.
 
 408
 00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,552
 Gentlemen, if we could come
 to some accommodation here now.
 
 409
 00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,109
 There's always a way
 to oil everyone's lock.
 
 410
 00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,034
 This young man is prepared
 to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...
 
 411
 00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,397
 ...for doing precisely nothing.
 - Really?
 
 412
 00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,111
 Ten percent of all future profits
 from his solo venture.
 
 413
 00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,193
 That's money you get paid
 for walking down to the mailbox.
 
 414
 00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,830
 Consider it a gesture of respect
 for your valuable contribution...
 
 415
 00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,675
 ...to the business thus far.
 I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.
 
 416
 00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,798
 That's charity, is what that is.
 
 417
 00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,439
 I do all the work.
 
 418
 00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,319
 He sits around on his fat ass
 judging people.
 
 419
 00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,992
 Escalating. Stop.
 
 420
 00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,631
 So there's that,
 but then there's one small detail.
 
 421
 00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,951
 Clearly a mistake was made
 on the part of our mutual associate...
 
 422
 00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,588
 ...when he paid you half
 of Jesse's earnings.
 
 423
 00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,150
 He must not have realised that you two
 had come to a parting of the ways.
 
 424
 00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,993
 Take it. It belongs to you.
 
 425
 00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,230
 You're damn right it belongs to me.
 
 426
 00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,676
 I knew I could count on you boys
 to play nice. That's...
 
 427
 00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,115
 - That almost brings a tear to my eye.
 - Enjoy it.
 
 428
 00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,510
 Spend it in good health.
 
 429
 00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,112
 That is the last money
 you'll ever earn in this business.
 
 430
 00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,830
 What the hell is that
 supposed to mean?
 
 431
 00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,628
 Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
 but our mutual associate...
 
 432
 00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,713
 ...was only using you to get to me.
 
 433
 00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,154
 What are you talking about?
 
 434
 00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,552
 See, he needs someone
 with expertise...
 
 435
 00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,355
 ...someone who knows
 what he's doing.
 
 436
 00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,956
 In other words, he needs me.
 
 437
 00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,596
 You're telling me
 you're cooking again?
 
 438
 00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,158
 Yeah.
 Let's see, how should I put this?
 
 439
 00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,314
 I'm in.
 
 440
 00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,074
 You're out.
 
 441
 00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,630
 Walt, hold on there.
 
 442
 00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,475
 What was the offer, if I may ask?
 
 443
 00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,630
 It's three million
 for three months of my time.
 
 444
 00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,712
 You're gonna need that money
 laundered. I mean, of course.
 
 445
 00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,154
 What was our deal before?
 
 446
 00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,356
 Seventeen percent.
 That's a shade high.
 
 447
 00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,717
 Let's settle on an even 15.
 That's a nice round number.
 
 448
 00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,869
 Five percent.
 
 449
 00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,598
 - Fourteen's fair.
 - Five.
 
 450
 00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,749
 - Thirteen.
 - Five.
 
 451
 00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,878
 - Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
 - Five.
 
 452
 00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,474
 I'm a reasonable guy.
 It's a short-term deal.
 
 453
 00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,950
 Ten even, but I can't go any lower
 and still respect myself.
 
 454
 00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,109
 Five.
 
 455
 00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,034
 What in the hell just happened?
 You're my lawyer, not his.
 
 456
 00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,510
 That's the way of the world, kid.
 Go with the winner.
 
 457
 00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,875
 You think this will stop me
 from cooking?
 
 458
 00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,519
 Cook whatever you like.
 
 459
 00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,468
 As long as it's that ridiculous
 Chilli P or some other dreck...
 
 460
 00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,712
 ...but don't even think
 about using my formula.
 
 461
 00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,917
 Just try and stop me, bitch.
 
 462
 00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,835
 - Yes?
 - Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?
 
 463
 00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,911
 - Yes.
 - Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.
 
 464
 00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,719
 I'm with the Drug Enforcement
 Administration.
 
 465
 00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,236
 We're interested in an RV that's
 registered to your name and address.
 
 466
 00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,038
 - Do you have an RV?
 - I did.
 
 467
 00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,952
 It was stolen months ago.
 
 468
 00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,791
 Stolen, huh? Yeah.
 
 469
 00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,677
 Well, then I'm curious as to why
 the theft was never reported.
 
 470
 00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,638
 I'm not seeing any records
 of it with the police or the DMV.
 
 471
 00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,473
 I just didn't get around to it.
 
 472
 00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,473
 May I ask why?
 
 473
 00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,398
 I mean, it's a great way
 to get the family together...
 
 474
 00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,959
 ...for an affordable vacation.
 
 475
 00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,111
 It must've been a blow
 when it went missing.
 
 476
 00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,838
 It was.
 
 477
 00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,039
 Do you have any ideas at all
 who might've taken it?
 
 478
 00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,675
 I didn't want him arrested.
 
 479
 00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,118
 He ran with a bad crowd,
 but he was never a bad person.
 
 480
 00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,597
 I thought he could turn
 his life around.
 
 481
 00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,478
 Who are we talking about,
 Mrs. Ortega?
 
 482
 00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,678
 My son.
 
 483
 00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,755
 I'd really like to speak with him.
 
 484
 00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,599
 He's passed away.
 He was shot two months ago.
 
 485
 00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,431
 - What was your son's name?
 - Christian.
 
 486
 00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,955
 Christian Ortega.
 
 487
 00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,040
 Was his nickname Combo?
 
 488
 00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,989
 Thanks for this.
 I really appreciate it.
