 â€‹1
 00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,669
 So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.
 
 2
 00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,998
 Crap.
 
 3
 00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,112
 There's an ATM right outside.
 
 4
 00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,556
 Yeah, I don't have a card.
 
 5
 00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,516
 Well, you can write a personal cheque
 with ID.
 
 6
 00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,237
 Kind of in between banks right now.
 
 7
 00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,038
 You think I could just
 come back later?
 
 8
 00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,112
 I'm totally good for it.
 I'd come back, I swear.
 
 9
 00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,991
 If it were me, I'd be totally,
 you know, "No problem."
 
 10
 00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,913
 But my dad is
 this ginormous hard-ass.
 
 11
 00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,356
 He was in Fallujah for a year.
 
 12
 00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,956
 And he always checks the receipts.
 I mean, like, always.
 
 13
 00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,118
 I gotta call him. I'm sorry.
 
 14
 00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,633
 Wait, wait, wait.
 
 15
 00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,871
 Hold on a second.
 
 16
 00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,195
 Maybe we could...
 
 17
 00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,752
 ...trade.
 
 18
 00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,913
 Ever try it?
 
 19
 00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,673
 I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.
 
 20
 00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,634
 I party.
 
 21
 00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,114
 But...
 
 22
 00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,199
 - But that stuff's really addictive, right?
 - Not really.
 
 23
 00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,670
 It's just a media thing. You know?
 
 24
 00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,351
 What's it like?
 
 25
 00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,719
 It's awesome.
 
 26
 00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,351
 Everything's maximum interesting.
 
 27
 00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,471
 You get these really cold
 and sharp-like action dagger feelings.
 
 28
 00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,673
 It's awesome.
 
 29
 00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,118
 Come on. What do you say?
 
 30
 00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,438
 Have a nice day.
 
 31
 00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,159
 So how does it feel?
 
 32
 00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,829
 Does it hurt?
 
 33
 00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,270
 Yeah, it's tight.
 
 34
 00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,637
 - Yeah, but is it painful?
 - It's hard to breathe.
 
 35
 00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,995
 Well, you need your breathing.
 
 36
 00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,751
 Although let's not lose sight
 of the fact...
 
 37
 00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,230
 ...that you were the victim
 of a terrible accident, Antonio...
 
 38
 00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,834
 ...so some discomfort is
 to be... expected.
 
 39
 00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,990
 Let's go with that one.
 
 40
 00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,157
 A cashier's chequ''e, por fav or.''
 
 41
 00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,233
 Oh, and spread the word.
 I'm building a class-action, flight 515.
 
 42
 00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,958
 Victims' families would be great.
 
 43
 00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
 I'll take anyone on the ground
 who suffered emotionally.
 
 44
 00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,912
 Anxiety, sleeplessness.
 You get the picture.
 
 45
 00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,399
 Trouble?
 
 46
 00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,836
 ''Ted Benek e? You cannot be serious.''
 
 47
 00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,197
 ''- That guy is a jok e.''
 ''- You know what? You called my bluff.''
 
 48
 00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,549
 ''What does that even mean?''
 
 49
 00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,757
 ''You dared me to tell the police''
 ''and I couldn't do it, so you win.''
 
 50
 00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,230
 ''If you want to stay in this house, fine,''
 ''but we are not married anymore.''
 
 51
 00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,631
 ''I told you that''
 ''I was done cooking meth, Skyler.''
 
 52
 00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,313
 ''- I promised you that.''
 - ''So what?''
 
 53
 00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,835
 ''You know what?''
 ''At least I didn't run off to go...''
 
 54
 00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,151
 ''Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,''
 ''I did for this family.''
 
 55
 00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,312
 ''- Just k eep telling yourself that.''
 ''- What is that supposed to mean?''
 
 56
 00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,118
 ''You don't lik e it, then leave.''
 
 57
 00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,477
 ''- And tak e your drug money with you.''
 ''- That's what you want.''
 
 58
 00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,595
 - Jesus.
 - Garbage disposal.
 
 59
 00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,512
 ''You think this will get me''
 ''to move out?''
 
 60
 00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,353
 ''You can screw Ted. You can screw''
 ''the butcher, the mailman.''
 
 61
 00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,919
 ''- God, Walt.''
 ''- Whoever you want.''
 
 62
 00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,674
 ''Screw them all.''
 ''I'm not going anywhere.''
 
 63
 00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,512
 ''Suit yourself.''
 
 64
 00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,190
 Is this a good or bad thing?
 
 65
 00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,788
 ''Suit myself.''
 ''You want me to suit myself?''
 
 66
 00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,678
 ''I'll suit myself to his face!''
 
 67
 00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,918
 It's a bad thing.
 
 68
 00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,793
 Hello.
 
 69
 00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,638
 Walter White to see Ted Beneke.
 
 70
 00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,679
 I'm sorry.
 Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.
 
 71
 00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,516
 Okay. I will wait.
 
 72
 00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,511
 It could be a while.
 
 73
 00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,558
 I have all the time in the world.
 
 74
 00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,111
 Okay.
 
 75
 00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,750
 - Here we go. Okay.
 - Excuse me.
 
 76
 00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,990
 - Mr. Beneke's not available.
 - Ted? Come on.
 
 77
 00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,798
 Sir, excuse me.
 
 78
 00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,268
 Excuse me.
 
 79
 00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,078
 Ted, I can see you.
 
 80
 00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,595
 I can see you standing right there
 in your office.
 
 81
 00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,795
 Now, come on.
 
 82
 00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,638
 Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
 I just want to talk. That's all.
 
 83
 00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,314
 Come on, let's be men about this.
 Okay? How about that?
 
 84
 00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,788
 Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
 of something now.
 
 85
 00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,598
 Oh, yes, you are.
 
 86
 00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,433
 So open the door.
 
 87
 00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,830
 You're damn right.
 You're right in the middle.
 
 88
 00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,355
 Just open the door
 and let's talk about it, okay?
 
 89
 00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,590
 Open the door, Ted, right now.
 
 90
 00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,548
 You don't want to be a man about it?
 Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.
 
 91
 00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,474
 We have a situation.
 
 92
 00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,835
 Walt. Walt. Walt.
 
 93
 00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,150
 What are you doing?
 
 94
 00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,959
 I'm talking with Ted.
 
 95
 00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,072
 Next time, you'll open the door.
 
 96
 00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,755
 - Freeze! Come on.
 - Oh, damn it.
 
 97
 00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,239
 No, I'm just here to talk.
 
 98
 00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,595
 - I just want to talk to him.
 - Outside. Let's go.
 
 99
 00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,196
 God. Can I just talk?
 I just want to talk to him.
 
 100
 00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,271
 - Calm down.
 - I'm just... Okay, all right.
 
 101
 00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,591
 All right, all right, all right.
 I'm calm. I'm calm.
 
 102
 00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,993
 Asshole.
 
 103
 00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,996
 What do you want?
 What do you want?
 
 104
 00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,958
 Hey! Hey, come on.
 
 105
 00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,679
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 
 106
 00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,195
 You act like you're the first guy
 this happened to.
 
 107
 00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,830
 I caught my second wife screwing
 my stepdad, okay?
 
 108
 00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,151
 It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.
 
 109
 00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,236
 - I just wanted to talk to him.
 - Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.
 
 110
 00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,231
 Consider this an inte... ntion.
 
 111
 00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,073
 You could have been arrested
 back there. You understand.
 
 112
 00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,152
 Speaking as your lawyer,
 I'm always looking for billable hours.
 
 113
 00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,470
 But speaking as
 your business associate...
 
 114
 00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,359
 ...I'm strongly advising
 that you get your shit together.
 
 115
 00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,598
 Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
 at least for now. Okay?
 
 116
 00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,435
 Let's talk shop, because
 I think this is a great opportunity...
 
 117
 00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,149
 ...to channel some of that negative
 energy into something positive.
 
 118
 00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,232
 - How did you know?
 - Sorry?
 
 119
 00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,875
 About Skyler.
 About where to find me just now.
 
 120
 00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,917
 How did you know?
 
 121
 00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,829
 That's just my meticulousness.
 Don't bog down in detail, Walt.
 
 122
 00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,958
 - The lesson here should be...
 - Did you bug my house?
 
 123
 00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,435
 Yeah, but I didn't know it was
 your house, did I?
 
 124
 00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,114
 You'd moved out.
 Besides, you basically told me to.
 
 125
 00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,158
 - I told you to?
 - You strongly hinted that I should.
 
 126
 00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,199
 You were worried your wife might say
 something to the police.
 
 127
 00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,751
 What? No, no, that's not true.
 When the hell did I say that?
 
 128
 00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,434
 Let's not get lost in the who,
 what and whens.
 
 129
 00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,673
 The point is we did our due diligence
 and she didn't talk.
 
 130
 00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,796
 She kept quiet.
 She stood by you, Walt...
 
 131
 00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,748
 ...which, if you ask me,
 is the ironical silver lining here.
 
 132
 00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,672
 I mean, on the one hand...
 
 133
 00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,436
 ...sure, she snuck off the reservation
 to get some dirty, damp and deep.
 
 134
 00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,828
 On the other hand...
 
 135
 00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,794
 Off me.
 
 136
 00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,197
 You're fired!
 
 137
 00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,713
 - You're done!
 - Good!
 
 138
 00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,598
 "Oh, boohoo,
 I won't cook meth anymore".
 
 139
 00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,557
 You're a crybaby. Who needs you?
 
 140
 00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,314
 I'm unplugging the website,
 so no more money laundering.
 
 141
 00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,469
 How do you like that?
 
 142
 00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,234
 I want those bugs
 out of my house today.
 
 143
 00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,550
 I want them out now!
 
 144
 00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,349
 You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!
 
 145
 00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,233
 Go.
 
 146
 00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,309
 Great, drilled right into the stucco.
 
 147
 00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,439
 A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.
 
 148
 00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,468
 Just make sure
 you get all of those things.
 
 149
 00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,792
 A, these things cost $800 apiece.
 
 150
 00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,439
 B, you're not that interesting.
 
 151
 00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,558
 So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.
 
 152
 00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,993
 Great line of work, by the way.
 Real upstanding field.
 
 153
 00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,952
 Yeah, well...
 
 154
 00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,511
 ...I enjoy it.
 
 155
 00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,111
 You're free to leave now. Anytime.
 
 156
 00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,234
 You know, Walter...
 
 157
 00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,594
 ...sometimes it doesn't hurt
 to have someone watching your back.
 
 158
 00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,919
 Mr. White?
 
 159
 00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,793
 Hi.
 
 160
 00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,199
 What's up?
 
 161
 00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,839
 I can't begin to understand
 what you're going through, Walt...
 
 162
 00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,790
 ...with all of your health concerns
 and the stresses you've been under.
 
 163
 00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,518
 But still, as educators...
 
 164
 00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,559
 ...there are certain responsibilities
 we need to be meeting here...
 
 165
 00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,359
 ...to the school
 and to the students themselves.
 
 166
 00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,033
 Of course.
 
 167
 00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,679
 Is this a wheaten terrier?
 
 168
 00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,113
 Norfolk.
 
 169
 00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,079
 Norfolk?
 
 170
 00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,637
 That's surprising.
 
 171
 00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,228
 Walt, could you come back over here
 and have a seat, please?
 
 172
 00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,519
 Sure.
 
 173
 00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,233
 You've been absent a lot recently.
 
 174
 00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,315
 And when you are here at school, there
 have been some behavioural questions.
 
 175
 00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,869
 And frankly I'm concerned.
 
 176
 00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,189
 Thank you.
 
 177
 00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,433
 Are you feeling okay?
 
 178
 00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,472
 Do you think maybe
 I should call Skyler?
 
 179
 00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,232
 No.
 
 180
 00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,511
 Let's just keep this...
 
 181
 00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,272
 What...?
 
 182
 00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,833
 Hey!
 
 183
 00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,195
 Walt, what's wrong with you?
 
 184
 00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,759
 You know, look, you're the one
 always talking about D.C., okay?
 
 185
 00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,558
 This is how you get there.
 
 186
 00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,553
 You answer the bell.
 You pay your dues.
 
 187
 00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,917
 Besides, you know,
 it's a big deal to get picked for this.
 
 188
 00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,869
 El Paso's like the Super Bowl.
 
 189
 00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,033
 I could get killed crossing the street,
 okay?
 
 190
 00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,317
 Whatever. You know, I want to go.
 
 191
 00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,678
 What about last time?
 
 192
 00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,798
 What about last time?
 
 193
 00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,473
 Schrader.
 
 194
 00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,395
 Hey, sheriff. Yeah.
 
 195
 00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,749
 Blue, huh?
 
 196
 00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,832
 Yeah, yeah. Thing is...
 
 197
 00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,439
 Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
 on a plane right now.
 
 198
 00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,153
 The stuff this guy had was blue.
 You sure about that?
 
 199
 00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,632
 Yeah.
 
 200
 00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,518
 Yeah, I want to talk to him.
 
 201
 00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,993
 Taxi.
 
 202
 00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,599
 - Hi.
 - Man, I'm sorry.
 
 203
 00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,957
 I needed to talk to you,
 but you weren't at your apartment.
 
 204
 00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,390
 No, I moved back home.
 
 205
 00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,473
 That's good, right?
 
 206
 00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,589
 Yeah.
 
 207
 00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,752
 - Yo, did you just get fired?
 - No.
 
 208
 00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,351
 No, no, no.
 
 209
 00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,794
 It's more like a sabbatical.
 
 210
 00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,790
 Indefinite. Yeah.
 
 211
 00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,237
 So, what's up?
 
 212
 00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,837
 Should we go somewhere?
 
 213
 00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,076
 No, this is fine.
 
 214
 00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,713
 So I want an intro to your guy.
 
 215
 00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,279
 What guy?
 
 216
 00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,632
 Your guy. Your distribution guy.
 The guy Saul hooked you up with.
 
 217
 00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,870
 No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.
 
 218
 00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,394
 - I thought about it and I want to.
 - God.
 
 219
 00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,278
 It's the one thing I'm good at.
 
 220
 00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,034
 No, that is just not true.
 
 221
 00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,668
 You're good at a lot of things, son.
 
 222
 00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,159
 Like what?
 
 223
 00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,071
 What about your sobriety?
 
 224
 00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,155
 I told you, I'm not using.
 
 225
 00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,114
 Ever.
 
 226
 00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,876
 I just want back into the business.
 
 227
 00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,076
 Well, I don't. I'm sorry.
 
 228
 00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,318
 I know, and that's cool.
 
 229
 00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,950
 I'm not asking you to cook.
 
 230
 00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,752
 What's this?
 
 231
 00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,592
 In the... end, I just went with
 two reflux condensers.
 
 232
 00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,149
 I didn't want to lose track
 of my pH levels.
 
 233
 00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,154
 But I did everything else
 just like you taught me.
 
 234
 00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,633
 Super careful in my amounts...
 
 235
 00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,190
 ...and watched the numbers
 every step of the way.
 
 236
 00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,396
 So, what do you think?
 It's good, right?
 
 237
 00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,994
 What in the hell is this?
 
 238
 00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,312
 - What?
 - What?
 
 239
 00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,836
 This. This. This is my product.
 
 240
 00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,389
 This is my formula. This is mine.
 
 241
 00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,712
 It's our product,
 but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.
 
 242
 00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,472
 Oh, you were gonna cut me in?
 
 243
 00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,996
 No, no, no. I cut you in.
 
 244
 00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,835
 What the hell is your problem?
 All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.
 
 245
 00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,798
 - Absolutely not.
 - Why?
 
 246
 00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,599
 Because I am not gonna lend my name
 to an inferior product.
 
 247
 00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,035
 I mean, look at the diameters here.
 
 248
 00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,918
 What did you use for reduction?
 
 249
 00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,878
 Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?
 
 250
 00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,032
 No. Mercury-aluminium amalgam.
 
 251
 00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,270
 The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.
 
 252
 00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,590
 All right, well,
 you must've done it wrong, then.
 
 253
 00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,435
 Your colour is all cloudy, so you were
 struggling with distillation too.
 
 254
 00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,239
 Now, this is very shoddy work,
 Pinkman.
 
 255
 00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,277
 I'm actually embarrassed for you.
 
 256
 00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,994
 What?
 
 257
 00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,509
 No way. I gave out samples
 and everyone said it was the bomb.
 
 258
 00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,995
 Oh, they said it was the bomb.
 
 259
 00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,038
 And who were they, I wonder?
 A bunch of meth heads?
 
 260
 00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,189
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 
 261
 00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,920
 - They should know, right?
 - Yeah, well, sorry.
 
 262
 00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,310
 - I can't help you.
 - Fine, ass-wad.
 
 263
 00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,392
 - I'll contact the guy myself.
 - Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.
 
 264
 00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,711
 Because my guy is a pro
 and he doesn't deal with junkies.
 
 265
 00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,519
 - You know what? Eat me.
 - Anytime, loser.
 
 266
 00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,749
 Hey, hey, hey!
 
 267
 00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,828
 Wait. Hey!
 
 268
 00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,834
 I can't believe it's only 4:00.
 
 269
 00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,117
 This day is dragging.
 
 270
 00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,038
 Okay.
 
 271
 00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,037
 I wish I could stay.
 
 272
 00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,676
 So stay.
 
 273
 00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,431
 What's stopping you?
 
 274
 00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,758
 What, like... everything, you mean?
 
 275
 00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,833
 How about my lunatic husband
 refusing to leave the house?
 
 276
 00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,077
 So move in here.
 
 277
 00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,755
 And then my son hating me
 even more.
 
 278
 00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,514
 That'll pass.
 I went through that with the girls.
 
 279
 00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,079
 They adapt.
 
 280
 00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,792
 And now everyone at work thinks
 I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.
 
 281
 00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,599
 They're all fired,
 effective immediately.
 
 282
 00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,318
 What else?
 
 283
 00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,552
 Oh, aren't you the answer man?
 
 284
 00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,514
 Where did it...?
 
 285
 00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,397
 Where did it go wrong, exactly,
 with you and Walt?
 
 286
 00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,751
 I mean, I always saw him as kind of...
 
 287
 00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,158
 ...mild-mannered.
 
 288
 00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,828
 Something, I don't know,
 change when he got sick or...?
 
 289
 00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,396
 I don't know what changed, Ted.
 
 290
 00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,551
 And I just don't feel really comfortable
 talking about it.
 
 291
 00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,598
 Sorry.
 
 292
 00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,876
 Just asking out of self-interest.
 
 293
 00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,600
 Gotta make sure
 I don't make the same mistake.
 
 294
 00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,716
 I would be amazed.
 
 295
 00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,835
 Just let me see if
 I'm following you here, Russell.
 
 296
 00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,596
 You got this stuff from some guy
 at Gasparza's...
 
 297
 00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,512
 ...who was wearing tan pants...
 
 298
 00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,673
 ...and who you're 80 percent sure
 had a moustache.
 
 299
 00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,193
 That's it, right?
 
 300
 00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,069
 That's your brain
 working at maximum capacity?
 
 301
 00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,198
 Russell.
 
 302
 00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,390
 Everything all right in there?
 
 303
 00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,110
 Mel. The dude's name was Mel.
 
 304
 00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,599
 Well, there you go. See?
 You served an actual earthly function.
 
 305
 00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,557
 I can't believe I remembered that.
 
 306
 00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,599
 Mel who?
 Does he have a last name?
 
 307
 00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,916
 Yeah, Mel.
 
 308
 00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,834
 Wait.
 
 309
 00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,349
 Was it Mel...
 
 310
 00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,869
 ...or Mark?
 
 311
 00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,958
 It was definitely an M name.
 
 312
 00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,156
 Oh, man, I'm losing it.
 
 313
 00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,675
 Wait, wait.
 
 314
 00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,232
 Yeah.
 
 315
 00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,070
 It's gone.
 
 316
 00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,559
 It's gone.
 
 317
 00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,870
 - It was an M name though.
 - Yeah.
 
 318
 00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,838
 I remember the... sound.
 
 319
 00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,552
 All right, well,
 we'll go with the... sound.
 
 320
 00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,358
 - Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
 - Yeah.
 
 321
 00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,476
 He definitely had tan pants.
 
 322
 00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,437
 Remind me to get a vasectomy.
 
 323
 00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,194
 Okay, it's after 9,
 so this bar that Girl George is at...
 
 324
 00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,237
 ...probably wall-to-wall dirtbags
 by now.
 
 325
 00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,599
 Let's go have a little looky-loo,
 see if we can't find this M-named clown.
 
 326
 00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,349
 What? It's a lead.
 
 327
 00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,239
 - Lead to what?
 - To Heisenberg.
 
 328
 00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,710
 I told you it was only a matter of time
 before this guy booted up again.
 
 329
 00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,757
 Here we go, my friend.
 
 330
 00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,876
 Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
 Gomey.
 
 331
 00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,873
 Just apologise and buy me a beer.
 
 332
 00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,791
 Man, you're reaching.
 
 333
 00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,919
 This stuff could be a knockoff
 or left over from an older cook.
 
 334
 00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,594
 How do you know Heisenberg's
 gearing up again?
 
 335
 00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,231
 How do I know?
 
 336
 00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,991
 Because I know.
 
 337
 00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,513
 I don't get it.
 
 338
 00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,877
 This is the reason why
 you're blowing off the task force?
 
 339
 00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,837
 Chase down teeners?
 
 340
 00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,518
 I'm getting tired
 of all the second-guessing.
 
 341
 00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,276
 If you're not sufficiently stimulated
 by this investigation...
 
 342
 00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,590
 ...do us both a favour
 and ask for a transfer.
 
 343
 00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,035
 What is up with you lately?
 
 344
 00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,795
 Starting bar fights,
 turning down El Paso...
 
 345
 00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,279
 ...and now this bullshit?
 
 346
 00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,280
 Do you need to talk to someone
 or what?
 
 347
 00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,598
 Talk to someone?
 
 348
 00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,958
 Talk to who?
 
 349
 00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,075
 I'm not trying to step on your toes,
 bro. Okay?
 
 350
 00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,795
 I'm just worried about you.
 That's all.
 
 351
 00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,157
 Appreciate that, bro.
 
 352
 00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,389
 Now take your hand off my shoulder.
 
 353
 00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,192
 Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.
 
 354
 00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,238
 Did any little piece
 fall on your property?
 
 355
 00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,278
 I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
 Mr. Linkas.
 
 356
 00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,352
 It could be a nut or a bolt.
 It could be a bag of peanuts...
 
 357
 00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,557
 ...just so long as it caused you
 pain and suffering.
 
 358
 00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,154
 Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
 Calling you back.
 
 359
 00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,474
 You had your chance.
 I told you to get him cooking again.
 
 360
 00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,349
 You blew it off and now it's too late.
 The guy's gone mass maniac on us!
 
 361
 00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,750
 All I wanted was to show you two
 your potential.
 
 362
 00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,115
 And what do I get in return?
 A bone contusion.
 
 363
 00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,477
 You wanna see the scar?
 I wish you two had...
 
 364
 00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,275
 Hi, there.
 
 365
 00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,876
 - How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
 - I made it.
 
 366
 00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,191
 You know the guy
 who knows the guy, right?
 
 367
 00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,598
 Well, good news is...
 
 368
 00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,912
 ...for a stage-three cancer,
 the guy's doing well physically.
 
 369
 00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,116
 Mentally, the guy's a disaster.
 
 370
 00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,670
 He's gone off the rails
 over this thing with his wife.
 
 371
 00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,595
 My opinion, he's not coming back.
 Not on his own.
 
 372
 00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,032
 Your friends were at his place again,
 by the way.
 
 373
 00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,272
 They drew something on the street
 outside his house.
 
 374
 00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,310
 - The scythe.
 - Animals.
 
 375
 00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,072
 - Does the lawyer know?
 - Should he?
 
 376
 00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,798
 No.
 
 377
 00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,679
 If you want this guy to produce again,
 why not just tell him?
 
 378
 00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,149
 You stand between him
 and an axe in the head.
 
 379
 00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,754
 I don't believe fear
 to be an effective motivator.
 
 380
 00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,751
 I want investment.
 
 381
 00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,431
 For now, I'm simply interested
 in time frame.
 
 382
 00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,398
 He will live for the foreseeable future,
 yes?
 
 383
 00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,960
 Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
 barring acts of God and men with axes.
 
 384
 00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,595
 From the lawyer,
 I'm supposed to let you know...
 
 385
 00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,354
 ...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.
 
 386
 00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,956
 - I don't work with junkies.
 - That's what I thought you'd say.
 
 387
 00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,872
 Probably for the best.
 
 388
 00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,315
 What I hear,
 he and Walter are splitsville.
 
 389
 00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,309
 Really?
 
 390
 00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,790
 That's what Goodman says.
 Cats and dogs.
 
 391
 00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,838
 Do the deal.
 
 392
 00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,511
 ''You have one unheard message.''
 
 393
 00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,309
 ''Agent Schrader, you need to be calling''
 ''me back ASAP.''
 
 394
 00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,995
 ''I've got Texas breathing down my neck''
 ''and I'm not about...''
 
 395
 00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,235
 No, I haven't see Matt since my dad
 fired him, like, a while ago.
 
 396
 00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,231
 Where can I find him, you think?
 
 397
 00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,278
 - No idea. Haven't seen him.
 - I know. You said that a few times.
 
 398
 00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,831
 Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
 I don't know what else to say.
 
 399
 00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,870
 - What's your name, darling?
 - Cara.
 
 400
 00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,989
 Where did this come from, Cara?
 
 401
 00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,916
 I don't know.
 
 402
 00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,953
 What is it? Drugs?
 
 403
 00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,351
 Look, I'm just gonna come right out
 and say it.
 
 404
 00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,280
 You're a bad liar, Cara.
 
 405
 00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,672
 Don't get me wrong.
 Not the worst I've... ever seen.
 
 406
 00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,596
 Once had a guy try to explain the dope
 balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.
 
 407
 00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,595
 Still, you're not a very good liar.
 
 408
 00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,192
 - I honestly don't know...
 - Stop.
 
 409
 00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,397
 You look like a good kid.
 I'm not here to get you in trouble.
 
 410
 00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,314
 But you need to tell me
 where this came from right now!
 
 411
 00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,119
 I never do stuff like this.
 I swear to God.
 
 412
 00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,473
 I tried it and I hated it,
 so I just gave it to Matt.
 
 413
 00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,551
 - Okay, and who gave it to you?
 - Some guy.
 
 414
 00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,633
 He came in a couple days ago
 and wanted to trade it for gas.
 
 415
 00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,712
 Some guy? What's his name?
 
 416
 00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,990
 Okay, what...? What did he look like?
 
 417
 00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,632
 I don't know.
 
 418
 00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,711
 He looked pretty normal.
 
 419
 00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,189
 You know, white.
 
 420
 00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,949
 I think his hair was lightish brown.
 
 421
 00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,995
 He had really blue... eyes.
 
 422
 00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,390
 They were really, really blue.
 
 423
 00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,199
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
 Okay, what else?
 
 424
 00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,115
 Piercings, jewellery, distinctive
 articles of clothing. Come on.
 
 425
 00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,592
 Come on.
 
 426
 00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,512
 Listen to me.
 
 427
 00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,355
 It's real important that I find the person
 that had these drugs.
 
 428
 00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,717
 So if you can remember
 anything else...
 
 429
 00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,672
 Come on, think.
 Come on, now. Come on.
 
 430
 00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,038
 He drove an RV.
 
 431
 00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,153
 Okay, good, good.
 
 432
 00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,472
 What can you remember?
 What kind of RV?
 
 433
 00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,393
 What colour?
 Did you spot a license plate?
 
 434
 00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,914
 I don't know the kinds
 and I didn't see the license.
 
 435
 00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,840
 But the colour was,
 I think, white, brownish colour.
 
 436
 00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,477
 I'm sorry.
 
 437
 00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,790
 I know I'm not helping you...
 
 438
 00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,189
 ...but, please, don't tell my dad.
 
 439
 00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,719
 Cara.
 
 440
 00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,111
 Please, tell me that
 that camera works.
 
 441
 00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,559
 Damn it.
 
 442
 00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,798
 Bingo.
 
 443
 00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,190
 These... eggs are good, Mom.
 
 444
 00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,114
 Thanks.
 
 445
 00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,232
 Hey, you know what's weird?
 Dad's website.
 
 446
 00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,153
 It's been three days
 since the last donation.
 
 447
 00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,434
 Yeah, well, people lose interest.
 
 448
 00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,593
 So how long are you off for?
 
 449
 00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,312
 A few weeks.
 
 450
 00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,195
 I'll play it by ear.
 
 451
 00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,636
 I probably pushed it, you know,
 going back to work too soon.
 
 452
 00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,550
 Think I can get a ride today?
 Louis has a doctor's appointment.
 
 453
 00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,919
 Yeah.
 
 454
 00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,668
 Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?
 
 455
 00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,473
 You won't have to take Holly
 to work every day.
 
 456
 00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,318
 Sometime, maybe.
 
 457
 00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,998
 Yeah, we'll see.
 
 458
 00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,273
 What's up?
 
 459
 00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,593
 I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.
 
 460
 00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,157
 Wait. No, no. No way.
 
 461
 00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,439
 Hey! Hey!
 
 462
 00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,473
 Hey. What the hell? This is only half.
 
 463
 00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,313
 That's right. It's your half.
 
 464
 00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,792
 Yo, where's the other half, bitch?
 
 465
 00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,912
 I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
 Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.
 
 466
 00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,868
 I think he actually thought
 we were the cable guys, you know.
 
 467
 00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,354
 Anyway, sorry about
 those missed calls, chief.
 
 468
 00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,590
 I'm changing providers.
 It won't happen again.
 
 469
 00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,475
 Are you going to El Paso, Hank?
 
 470
 00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,837
 Hell, yes.
 With pointy boots and bells on.
 
 471
 00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,752
 Got this break in the Heisenberg case.
 
 472
 00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,753
 The blue meth, you mean?
 The teenth?
 
 473
 00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,388
 Yeah, well,
 that teenth got things rolling.
 
 474
 00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,757
 I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
 That's where I got these.
 
 475
 00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,435
 The station's closed-circuit was down...
 Surprise, surprise.
 
 476
 00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,310
 - But I was able to pull some of these
 snapshots off an ATM security camera.
 
 477
 00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,869
 We always thought these guys
 might be camper-cooking.
 
 478
 00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,429
 First off, your typical Class C
 motor home...
 
 479
 00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,398
 ...is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
 of interior fixtures.
 
 480
 00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,030
 Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
 5000 pounds at least, okay?
 
 481
 00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,711
 See how high
 that suspension's riding?
 
 482
 00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,313
 No way, no how, this thing's carrying
 that kind of weight.
 
 483
 00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,155
 This thing has been cleared out and
 stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.
 
 484
 00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,551
 For what? Blood bank?
 
 485
 00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,756
 Maybe a bookmobile?
 
 486
 00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,593
 There's no clear view of the plates.
 
 487
 00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,955
 Yeah, well, you can only get
 so lucky, right?
 
 488
 00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,635
 But there's no front plate. Tells me
 it's likely New Mexico registration.
 
 489
 00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,869
 I check with DMV.
 
 490
 00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,238
 There are only 29 of these... early-'80s
 Bounders registered in the state.
 
 491
 00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,318
 - Only 29?
 - Yeah.
 
 492
 00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,631
 So I gotta go, you know,
 knock on some doors.
 
 493
 00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,752
 They need you in El Paso, Hank.
 
 494
 00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,509
 You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
 this Heisenberg thing first.
 
 495
 00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,035
 - You're refusing the assignment.
 - I'm not. I'll go.
 
 496
 00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,997
 It's just I need some more time.
 
 497
 00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,879
 You're not hearing me,
 Agent Schrader.
 
 498
 00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,872
 You're out of time.
 
 499
 00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,236
 Are you going to El Paso now,
 tonight?
 
 500
 00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,395
 It's a simple yes or no.
 
 501
 00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,231
 No. I can't.
 
 502
 00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,079
 But that's only because
 I'm really close to something big here.
 
 503
 00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,876
 Better get to it, then.
 
 504
 00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,111
 ''This is KEC A 480,''
 ''Albuquerque's news radio.''
 
 505
 00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,350
 ''KEC A news time, 10:13.''
 
 506
 00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,829
 ''Our top story this hour,''
 ''Donald Margolis...''
 
 507
 00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,834
 ''...the air-traffic controller criticised''
 ''for his role in the recent air disaster...''
 
 508
 00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,956
 ''...in which 167 persons died...''
 
 509
 00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,634
 ''...was rushed to an area hospital''
 ''early this morning...''
 
 510
 00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,519
 ''...apparently the victim of''
 ''a self-inflicted gunshot wound.''
 
 511
 00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,114
 ''Police won't say whether or not...''
 
 512
 00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,598
 Your half.
 
 513
 00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,798
 Okay, okay.
