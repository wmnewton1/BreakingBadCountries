 1
 00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,110
 Hey, Captain America.
 
 2
 00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,235
 -What's up, brother?
 -Hey, bro.
 
 3
 00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,751
 This is stupid.
 
 4
 00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,632
 -You got a better idea?
 -Okay, fun. Whatever.
 
 5
 00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,832
 -So when do we, you know?
 -We don't, for now.
 
 6
 00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,156
 No cooking until things settle down.
 
 7
 00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,069
 Settle down? I thought you're the one
 that said nothing's changed.
 
 8
 00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,316
 Look, I just put my family
 through an ordeal...
 
 9
 00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,798
 ...that they're just now
 starting to accept, okay? I can't--
 
 10
 00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,475
 That's too expensive.
 
 11
 00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,029
 Look, I can't leave my house...
 
 12
 00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,515
 ...for more than 20 minutes
 without my wife worrying.
 
 13
 00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,472
 I need time to mend fences.
 
 14
 00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,355
 Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
 what about me, huh?
 
 15
 00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,030
 Your A-hole brother-in-law
 took all my money.
 
 16
 00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,439
 That's $600.
 
 17
 00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,959
 Okay, what about the rest?
 
 18
 00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,433
 -Rest of what?
 -Half your money's mine.
 
 19
 00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,756
 Fifty-fifty partners.
 That's our business motto.
 
 20
 00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,997
 Meaning what, exactly?
 That I suffer for your carelessness?
 
 21
 00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,077
 You're the one who wanted
 to work with Tuco.
 
 22
 00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,033
 Okay. If it weren't for that,
 none of this would've happened.
 
 23
 00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,272
 Just be cool.
 We'll talk about this later, okay?
 
 24
 00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,036
 As for now, no contact. Understood?
 
 25
 00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,475
 Where are you going?
 
 26
 00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,359
 I leave first.
 
 27
 00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,755
 -Walt!
 -In the kitchen.
 
 28
 00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,754
 Hey.
 
 29
 00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,916
 Hey. I didn't know
 you were allowed to touch the stove.
 
 30
 00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,271
 Hilarious, Groucho.
 Go on, grab a seat.
 
 31
 00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,959
 Juice is on the table.
 
 32
 00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,275
 What?
 
 33
 00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,079
 -Good morning, honey.
 -Hey, Mom.
 
 34
 00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,714
 Dad's cooking breakfast.
 
 35
 00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,639
 But don't worry.
 I'm also doing all the dishes.
 
 36
 00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,916
 Nice? Follow me.
 
 37
 00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,998
 There's also orange juice
 and grapefruit juice...
 
 38
 00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,033
 ...which, personally, as you know,
 I've never been a fan of.
 
 39
 00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,199
 But considering all the polyphenols
 and the limonoids, can't hurt.
 
 40
 00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,029
 Walt, you didn't have to do this.
 
 41
 00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,433
 I wanted to.
 
 42
 00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,398
 -Grapefruit juice?
 -Yes, please. Thanks.
 
 43
 00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,995
 There you go. Honey?
 
 44
 00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,430
 No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.
 
 45
 00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,911
 All right. Dig in, dig in.
 Pancakes are not getting hotter.
 
 46
 00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,593
 -Yeah.
 -There you go.
 
 47
 00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,189
 All right. Got one. Steely Dan.
 
 48
 00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,233
 -No.
 -Yes, absolutely.
 
 49
 00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,908
 No, in terms of pure musicianship...
 
 50
 00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,839
 ...I would put them up against
 any current band you can name.
 
 51
 00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,474
 You wouldn't know
 any current bands.
 
 52
 00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,669
 -That's besides the point.
 -Have a good day, honey.
 
 53
 00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,359
 You too.
 
 54
 00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,672
 -Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
 -Boz Scaggs.
 
 55
 00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,236
 Whoever they are.
 Bye. Thanks for breakfast.
 
 56
 00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,395
 -Bye.
 -You're welcome.
 
 57
 00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,113
 Tell Louis to drive carefully.
 
 58
 00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,673
 All right.
 
 59
 00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,710
 Our son doesn't know
 who Boz Scaggs is.
 
 60
 00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,070
 We have failed as parents.
 
 61
 00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,715
 Come to think of it...
 
 62
 00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,434
 -...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
 -Stop it.
 
 63
 00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,677
 Give me your plate.
 No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.
 
 64
 00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,233
 Thank you.
 
 65
 00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,712
 Hey, listen...
 
 66
 00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,036
 ...in the calendar section...
 
 67
 00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,591
 ...all week long...
 
 68
 00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,955
 ...there's a fiction writer's seminar
 at UNM.
 
 69
 00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,391
 And, you know, probably talking
 about how to get published...
 
 70
 00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,989
 -...and that sort of thing.
 -Yeah?
 
 71
 00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,789
 Yeah, so, anyway,
 I thought maybe you might....
 
 72
 00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,711
 I mean, I'll go with you if you like.
 
 73
 00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,711
 Oh, and...
 
 74
 00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,676
 ...you know, I was thinking about
 what you asked me the other night.
 
 75
 00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,110
 You were wondering
 if I had a second cell phone.
 
 76
 00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,709
 And, well, I've been
 thinking about that a lot...
 
 77
 00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,835
 ...and I think what you heard
 was my cell phone alarm going off.
 
 78
 00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,232
 I've been using it a lot
 as a medication reminder...
 
 79
 00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,439
 ...to, well, remind me
 to take my medication.
 
 80
 00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,434
 And, well, the weird thing is that...
 
 81
 00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,269
 ...the alarm sound
 is almost exactly the same...
 
 82
 00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,472
 ...as the regular phone ring
 which is really a poor design...
 
 83
 00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,150
 ...if you ask me.
 But I think that was probably it.
 
 84
 00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,352
 I tried to go in
 and change it to a different sound...
 
 85
 00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,755
 ...other than the phone ring, but....
 
 86
 00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,998
 They so overcomplicate
 these things.
 
 87
 00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,396
 Anyway, it was probably
 just as well that I lost it.
 
 88
 00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,629
 There's gotta be a new one
 on the market by now.
 
 89
 00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,515
 You know, if we do this thing
 at UNM, maybe on the way home...
 
 90
 00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,632
 ...we can stop by,
 and I can get a new cell phone.
 
 91
 00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,479
 Skyler?
 
 92
 00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,235
 Skyler?
 
 93
 00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,078
 -Ready?
 -Yo, for what, might help.
 
 94
 00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,320
 Not another intervention.
 
 95
 00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,151
 Jesse Bruce Pinkman...
 
 96
 00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,079
 ...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...
 
 97
 00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,157
 ...of the New Mexico
 Real Property Code...
 
 98
 00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,191
 ...you are hereby
 given notice to vacate...
 
 99
 00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,757
 ...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
 Albuquerque, 87104.
 
 100
 00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,077
 Wait. What? You're kicking me
 out of my own house?
 
 101
 00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,589
 -It's your aunt Ginny's house.
 -And she gave it to me.
 
 102
 00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,233
 She never gave it to you, Jesse.
 
 103
 00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,079
 You were allowed
 residentiary privileges.
 
 104
 00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,397
 Your parents have always
 been the property owners.
 
 105
 00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,149
 Look, we talked about this, okay?
 I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.
 
 106
 00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,669
 That was the deal.
 What the hell happened?
 
 107
 00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,440
 What happened is
 you're a speed manufacturer.
 
 108
 00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,835
 No, I'm not. What?
 
 109
 00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,476
 A DEA agent came
 looking for you, Jesse.
 
 110
 00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,875
 He came to our front door.
 
 111
 00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,629
 Okay, because I've actually
 been helping them...
 
 112
 00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,469
 ...which I could get into
 a lot of trouble for telling you...
 
 113
 00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,557
 ...so you're welcome.
 
 114
 00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,830
 I saw your basement.
 
 115
 00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,869
 Oh, yeah.
 
 116
 00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,789
 I was worried, so I went
 over there and I let myself in...
 
 117
 00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,198
 ...and I found your laboratory.
 
 118
 00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,990
 You guys have your own key?
 
 119
 00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,550
 Manufacture of a Schedule ll
 controlled substance...
 
 120
 00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,390
 ...is a second degree felony.
 
 121
 00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,713
 Under federal asset seizure...
 
 122
 00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,957
 ...the government can take
 the entire house.
 
 123
 00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,676
 It's not even there anymore.
 I cleaned it all out.
 
 124
 00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,269
 Son, we can't stop you
 from ruining your life...
 
 125
 00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,756
 ...but you will not drag us down
 with you.
 
 126
 00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,799
 Vacate the house in 72 hours.
 
 127
 00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,911
 Otherwise,
 your parents have authorised me...
 
 128
 00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,396
 ...to contact the authorities.
 Is that clear?
 
 129
 00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,035
 Do you have any questions for us?
 
 130
 00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,918
 Three days, Mr. Pinkman.
 
 131
 00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,154
 Come on.
 
 132
 00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,679
 -Hi.
 -Hey.
 
 133
 00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,789
 -I fixed the garage door.
 -Great.
 
 134
 00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,353
 Yeah.
 
 135
 00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
 One track was bent.
 That's why it was bouncing.
 
 136
 00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,799
 Okay.
 
 137
 00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,519
 -Where were you today?
 -Out.
 
 138
 00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,631
 Is everything okay?
 
 139
 00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,478
 Yeah, everything's fine.
 
 140
 00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,833
 Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
 about going back to those meetings...
 
 141
 00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,837
 ...the cancer support group.
 
 142
 00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,792
 I think that that's good.
 
 143
 00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,554
 Yeah.
 
 144
 00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,550
 Yeah, that's good.
 
 145
 00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,594
 You were right
 on the money about that.
 
 146
 00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,991
 It's good to, you know...
 
 147
 00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,836
 ...talk about things.
 
 148
 00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,357
 I think that's great.
 
 149
 00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,838
 Yeah.
 
 150
 00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,033
 Jesse.
 
 151
 00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,909
 Jesse. Hey, Jesse.
 
 152
 00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,509
 You don't answer your phone?
 
 153
 00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,951
 Yeah, no, I've just been...
 
 154
 00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,674
 ...pretty busy. How'd you--?
 
 155
 00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,475
 Oh, right, you have that key.
 
 156
 00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,916
 Hey, listen.
 
 157
 00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,194
 So I've been thinking
 a lot about our conversation...
 
 158
 00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,632
 ...we had the other day,
 and I completely get why...
 
 159
 00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,037
 ...Dad totally tweaked off on me
 like that and....
 
 160
 00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,789
 -It's not just your father, Jesse.
 -No, I know. I know. I know.
 
 161
 00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,994
 I'm just saying it was a really,
 really big wake-up call for me...
 
 162
 00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,033
 ...which is why I wanted to talk
 to you. You know, I've been...
 
 163
 00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,516
 ...thinking real seriously
 about business school, actually.
 
 164
 00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,075
 You can do the whole thing
 from your computer now....
 
 165
 00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,636
 No, Mom, Mom.
 Hey, hey, this is good.
 
 166
 00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,435
 You know, we're talking,
 starting a dialogue.
 
 167
 00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,837
 The time for talking
 has passed, Jesse.
 
 168
 00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,111
 Hey. Hey.
 
 169
 00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,639
 What the hell, yo?
 
 170
 00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,877
 -I thought it was just a wake-up call.
 -We are putting it in storage.
 
 171
 00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,196
 When you decide to grow up,
 you can have it back.
 
 172
 00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,595
 Why don't you grow up, Mom?
 
 173
 00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,792
 Ginny wanted me here.
 I was the one who took care of her.
 
 174
 00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,151
 I took her to her appointments
 and made her lunch every day.
 
 175
 00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,554
 I earned this.
 
 176
 00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,990
 You did not make
 her lunch every day.
 
 177
 00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,872
 What did you do, huh?
 
 178
 00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,640
 She's lying there dying,
 and where the hell are you?
 
 179
 00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,035
 -Don't start with me.
 -Now what?
 
 180
 00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,391
 You've decided to, I don't know,
 make your eldest son homeless?
 
 181
 00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,710
 Great family, Mom.
 
 182
 00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,676
 Why are you like this? Why?
 
 183
 00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,588
 You have two sets of keys
 and the padlock to the garage.
 
 184
 00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,508
 Leave them on the kitchen counter
 when you leave.
 
 185
 00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,039
 No, Mom, Mom, Mom.
 
 186
 00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,198
 Hey, where am I supposed to go?
 
 187
 00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,556
 I don't know, sweetheart.
 
 188
 00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,788
 But please turn your life around.
 
 189
 00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,912
 Yeah, this is gonna help
 bigtime with that. Bitch!
 
 190
 00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,871
 Jeez.
 
 191
 00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,869
 Oh, hey, Mr. White.
 
 192
 00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,719
 Hey, well, that's the way.
 Don't just sit out there honking.
 
 193
 00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,194
 Come in and say hello.
 
 194
 00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,153
 Hey, we've got omelettes.
 You want an omelette?
 
 195
 00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,355
 No, I'm good.
 
 196
 00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,393
 New Mexican Christmas style,
 red and green chillies.
 
 197
 00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,397
 No. Thank you, though.
 
 198
 00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,239
 Flynn and me gotta get going.
 
 199
 00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,077
 -Who's Flynn?
 -Flynn.
 
 200
 00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,157
 He's your....
 
 201
 00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,951
 -Flynn?
 -Yeah.
 
 202
 00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,673
 So?
 
 203
 00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,637
 So? Nothing.
 
 204
 00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,350
 -You ready?
 -Like it.
 
 205
 00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,198
 -Bye, Mr. White.
 -Okay.
 
 206
 00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,439
 Bye.
 
 207
 00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,348
 Flynn? You know about this
 Flynn thing?
 
 208
 00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,069
 Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
 As in what, Errol?
 
 209
 00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,397
 I don't know. It's what he likes
 to be called these days.
 
 210
 00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,397
 What's wrong with Walter Jr.?
 
 211
 00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,511
 Don't take it personally.
 
 212
 00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,556
 He wants his own identity.
 
 213
 00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,312
 You think he told Louis about me?
 
 214
 00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,830
 -About the blackout?
 -Louis is his friend, Walt...
 
 215
 00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,508
 ...and your disappearance
 upset him.
 
 216
 00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,710
 Hey, I made omelettes.
 
 217
 00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,354
 I'm going out, but thanks, though.
 
 218
 00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,039
 Where you going?
 
 219
 00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,476
 Can you get the phone, please?
 
 220
 00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,156
 Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
 
 221
 00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,989
 -White residence.
 -''Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?''
 
 222
 00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,190
 What part of "no contact"
 didn't you understand?
 
 223
 00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,392
 -I know, but there's a problem.
 -''I don't care. We agreed.''
 
 224
 00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,558
 No amount of pay-per-view channels
 is gonna make any difference.
 
 225
 00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,955
 Honey, we're happy
 with our cable provider, right?
 
 226
 00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,874
 Yeah, we're happy.
 
 227
 00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,791
 Skyler? Sky?
 
 228
 00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,875
 Where are you going?
 Can you at least tell me that?
 
 229
 00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,433
 Out.
 
 230
 00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,315
 Should probably get that, Walt.
 I'll be back in a few hours.
 
 231
 00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,432
 Skyler.
 
 232
 00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,598
 -What?
 -Yo, I get I shouldn't call...
 
 233
 00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,155
 ...but I'm in a situation here,
 and I need my money.
 
 234
 00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,998
 I just gave you $600.
 
 235
 00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,428
 And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...
 
 236
 00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,631
 ...but that was
 before my housing situation...
 
 237
 00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,876
 ...went completely
 testicular on me, okay?
 
 238
 00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,991
 ''You smoked the entire 600,''
 ''didn't you?''
 
 239
 00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,428
 -What? No.
 -''Yes.''
 
 240
 00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,675
 -No.
 -''Look, Jesse...''
 
 241
 00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,359
 ''...your problems are just that.:''
 
 242
 00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,152
 Your problems.
 
 243
 00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,954
 No contact. Do not call here ever.
 
 244
 00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,869
 -When the moment is right, I will call.
 -''Mr. White, you're not listening.''
 
 245
 00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,196
 They're kicking me out of my house.
 
 246
 00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,832
 You son of a bitch.
 
 247
 00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,276
 Son of a bitch.
 
 248
 00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,070
 Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.
 
 249
 00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,113
 Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
 You forgot something! Yeah!
 
 250
 00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,790
 You forgot your ice trays!
 You're gonna need the ice trays!
 
 251
 00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,231
 Hey, you forgot something here!
 Take this!
 
 252
 00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,394
 Hold on, buddy.
 
 253
 00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,672
 Yo, we should get TwaüghtHammër
 up and running again, yo. I'm serious.
 
 254
 00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,916
 I know. That sounded tight.
 
 255
 00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,872
 Hey, thanks again, P.
 
 256
 00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,914
 I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
 you know, put me on his speed dial.
 
 257
 00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,189
 Two nights tops.
 
 258
 00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,709
 No, you still staying
 at your aunt's on Margo?
 
 259
 00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,309
 Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
 Nob Hill, probably.
 
 260
 00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,718
 Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.
 
 261
 00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,915
 Yeah.
 
 262
 00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,157
 Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
 carrots like we talked about, right?
 
 263
 00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,315
 Too hot.
 
 264
 00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,432
 No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
 Come on, yes.
 
 265
 00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,993
 Listen, hey, talk to me, man.
 
 266
 00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,589
 Are you still having
 mad relations out there?
 
 267
 00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,836
 You can talk to me.
 I won't hate a player.
 
 268
 00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,636
 I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
 out there, female-wise.
 
 269
 00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,915
 Damn. I'm hating, man.
 
 270
 00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,918
 That's why we need to get the Hammer
 up and running, you know?
 
 271
 00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,556
 -Get you out of the house.
 -How awesome would that be?
 
 272
 00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,352
 Come on. Look. What?
 
 273
 00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,917
 I cut all the green parts off like you—Just eat them. Please?
 
 274
 00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,556
 We should do this. Track down
 Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.
 
 275
 00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,829
 Get back in the scene.
 
 276
 00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,755
 I'm sorry, man.
 Just hold on one second, all right?
 
 277
 00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,918
 Okay, listen. How about
 you take a bite of your sandwich...
 
 278
 00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,712
 ...and then you take—279
 00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,396
 Mommy's home.
 
 280
 00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,355
 -Hi.
 -Hello.
 
 281
 00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,869
 Hey, honey, you remember
 Jesse Pinkman?
 
 282
 00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,718
 His house is getting bug bombed.
 I said he could crash a few nights.
 
 283
 00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,751
 -Hey, Jesse.
 -Hey.
 
 284
 00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,349
 Paul, could you help me
 in the bedroom with these?
 
 285
 00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,760
 Sure. Yeah.
 
 286
 00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,397
 Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.
 
 287
 00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,116
 Hey, Hen, I think
 it's someone's nap time. Come on.
 
 288
 00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,357
 Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.
 
 289
 00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,997
 I totally spaced that the in-laws
 are crashing this weekend.
 
 290
 00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,553
 You got other people to call?
 
 291
 00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,035
 No, that's cool.
 I got tons of people. Yeah.
 
 292
 00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,276
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 
 293
 00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,797
 Yo, in-laws?
 
 294
 00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,629
 -Sucks to be you, P.
 -Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?
 
 295
 00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,238
 Here.
 
 296
 00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,793
 See you, man.
 
 297
 00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,911
 It's good to see you.
 
 298
 00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,991
 Look, I'm asking to crash three,
 maybe four nights, and—299
 00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,033
 Look, I already called Badger,
 all right? I called everyone.
 
 300
 00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,595
 I need a solid here, bro.
 
 301
 00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,153
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
 
 302
 00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,110
 All right. All right.
 Hey, how about this?
 
 303
 00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,909
 What if it's just for tonight?
 
 304
 00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,833
 Wait. No, you cannot be serious.
 
 305
 00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,998
 -You cannot be serious.
 -Hey.
 
 306
 00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,229
 Someone took your bike, man.
 
 307
 00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,351
 Not cool.
 
 308
 00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,271
 -Morning.
 -Oh, hey.
 
 309
 00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,799
 Morning.
 
 310
 00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,993
 Where did--? Where did Mom go?
 
 311
 00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,358
 Out.
 
 312
 00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,470
 Where's breakfast?
 
 313
 00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,548
 Hey.
 
 314
 00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,472
 Let's go do something.
 
 315
 00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,232
 Like what?
 
 316
 00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,151
 Something fun.
 
 317
 00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,758
 All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.
 
 318
 00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,839
 -Is your foot on the—Okay. Good.
 -Yeah. I got it.
 
 319
 00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,035
 Good.
 
 320
 00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,710
 Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
 Just like that.
 
 321
 00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,352
 Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
 Very nice.
 
 322
 00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,755
 Okay, let's slow down here...
 
 323
 00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,952
 ...to a stop in preparation
 for a left-hand turn. Okay.
 
 324
 00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,958
 All right. You might wanna
 go easier on the brake.
 
 325
 00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,754
 -Sorry about that.
 -That's all right. You're doing fine.
 
 326
 00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,714
 -Much better than last time, huh?
 -Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.
 
 327
 00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,119
 Has he?
 
 328
 00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,550
 Good. Good. Okay.
 
 329
 00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,716
 Don't forget the turn indic—Good.
 
 330
 00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,229
 I'll stop talking.
 You know what you're doing.
 
 331
 00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,159
 And let's make that left-hand turn.
 
 332
 00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,914
 Nice and smooth. Very nice.
 
 333
 00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,639
 Right hand.
 
 334
 00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,555
 Good. Good. Okay.
 
 335
 00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,755
 -Are you using both feet?
 -Yeah.
 
 336
 00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,030
 No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
 You can't do that.
 
 337
 00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,276
 You can't use one foot
 on each pedal.
 
 338
 00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,074
 -Why not?
 -Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.
 
 339
 00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,831
 -Just stop, please. Right. All right.
 -Dad, this is way easier.
 
 340
 00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,119
 There's the easy way,
 and then there's the right way, right?
 
 341
 00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,278
 So let's just try it again,
 right foot only.
 
 342
 00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,118
 -All right.
 -Okay?
 
 343
 00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,796
 Okay, just—You don't have to—Okay. All right. That's fine.
 
 344
 00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,753
 Just—That's okay. That's okay.
 Just try it again.
 
 345
 00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,589
 Here we go.
 Let's just, just try it again.
 
 346
 00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,953
 Okay.
 
 347
 00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,391
 Don't-- Just easy.
 Okay, okay, good. Great.
 
 348
 00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,989
 That was better. See?
 Right? Better? Right.
 
 349
 00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,838
 The gas, the brake,
 the gas, the brake.
 
 350
 00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,439
 I can't do this.
 
 351
 00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,718
 My legs don't work that way.
 
 352
 00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,639
 Your legs are fine.
 You just have to stick with it.
 
 353
 00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,638
 Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
 You're all right.
 
 354
 00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,116
 All right. We'll get this. I promise.
 Now let's just try again. All right?
 
 355
 00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,390
 -All right.
 -Here we go. Here we go.
 
 356
 00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,273
 Okay, well, you don't need to,
 you know, just take off.
 
 357
 00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,119
 But all right, here we go.
 Slow it down just a little bit.
 
 358
 00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,791
 All right, we have a turn coming up
 here, so prepare to apply the brakes.
 
 359
 00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,230
 Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
 Brakes, the brakes.
 
 360
 00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,158
 -Braking.
 -You're using both feet again.
 
 361
 00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,555
 -It's not stopping.
 -That's the gas. Use the brake.
 
 362
 00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,478
 The break. Brake, brake, brake!
 
 363
 00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,719
 Okay.
 
 364
 00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,038
 That's one way to stop.
 
 365
 00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,672
 I told you.
 
 366
 00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,279
 Flynn.
 
 367
 00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,398
 -Hands up, asshole!
 -Yo, yo, it's cool.
 
 368
 00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,158
 So help me, I will spread you.
 
 369
 00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,318
 No, please, no, all right?
 It's me, okay? It's Jesse.
 
 370
 00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,236
 All right? Look, this is my RV.
 
 371
 00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,954
 You towed it.
 Your cousin Badger, remember?
 
 372
 00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,991
 What the hell you doing here?
 
 373
 00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,029
 -You smell like shit.
 -It's a long story.
 
 374
 00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,629
 So I fixed up your felonious
 rolling laboratory here...
 
 375
 00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,989
 ...750 for the repair.
 
 376
 00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,272
 Make it a grand, counting the toilet
 plus the 500 you already owe me...
 
 377
 00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,031
 ...and you're good to drive on out of
 here to someplace far away. Upwind.
 
 378
 00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,593
 Okay.
 
 379
 00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,793
 Here's the thing.
 
 380
 00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,319
 I can't pay you today.
 
 381
 00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,795
 But I can pay you this week,
 all right?
 
 382
 00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,757
 Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
 for, like, you know, interest.
 
 383
 00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,758
 -I thought your word was your bond.
 -It totally is.
 
 384
 00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,430
 Definitely. I just don't have
 the money at this particular moment.
 
 385
 00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,831
 But I will, soon.
 
 386
 00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,157
 Here's my counteroffer.
 
 387
 00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,352
 I kick you out.
 I take payment from your inventory.
 
 388
 00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,074
 I know a guy that'll pay
 premium for this kind of crap.
 
 389
 00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,636
 All right. Two grand. Okay?
 
 390
 00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,230
 Two days, two grand.
 That's totally fair.
 
 391
 00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,718
 Just don't take my cook stuff.
 All right? That's all I got left.
 
 392
 00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,150
 Please, all right? I really....
 
 393
 00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,912
 God, I really need a break here.
 Okay?
 
 394
 00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,677
 Clovis, come on.
 
 395
 00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,917
 I don't know.
 There's a bunch of stuff in there.
 
 396
 00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,714
 There's something called
 methylamine. Me—Meth....
 
 397
 00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,229
 However the hell you pronounce it.
 Methylamine.
 
 398
 00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,557
 I don't know. I banged on it.
 It sounds pretty full to me.
 
 399
 00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,230
 Holy shit. How much?
 
 400
 00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,234
 Hey! Hey!
 
 401
 00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,108
 Skyler.
 
 402
 00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,589
 Louis took Walt to school.
 
 403
 00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,511
 I was thinking maybe...
 
 404
 00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,076
 ...this would be a good time to talk.
 
 405
 00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,914
 I dreamt that I owned
 an antique bicycle repair shop.
 
 406
 00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,358
 In Ireland.
 
 407
 00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,874
 Weird.
 
 408
 00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,918
 Sounds weird.
 
 409
 00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,195
 I wanted to apologise...
 
 410
 00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,313
 ...for everything.
 
 411
 00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,519
 My...
 
 412
 00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,908
 ...desire for privacy.
 
 413
 00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,598
 My emotional...
 
 414
 00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,076
 ...unavailability.
 
 415
 00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,598
 Having cancer
 doesn't excuse all that.
 
 416
 00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,912
 I haven't been
 a good partner to you...
 
 417
 00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,638
 ...and for that...
 
 418
 00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,272
 ...I'm very sorry.
 
 419
 00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,039
 I love you.
 
 420
 00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,631
 And I love this family.
 
 421
 00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,918
 And I just...
 
 422
 00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,198
 ...want to make sure that...
 
 423
 00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,196
 ...we don't lose contact.
 
 424
 00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,273
 Thank you.
 
 425
 00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,079
 Okay.
 
 426
 00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,559
 I agree.
 
 427
 00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,959
 Is that it?
 
 428
 00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,469
 God.
 
 429
 00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,750
 God, how long are
 you gonna do this?
 
 430
 00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,390
 -Do what?
 -This.
 
 431
 00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,318
 Not talking to me.
 
 432
 00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,872
 Going out all day
 and refusing to tell me where.
 
 433
 00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,230
 You are obviously angry with me
 about something...
 
 434
 00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,476
 ...so let's talk about it.
 
 435
 00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,039
 Oh, God.
 
 436
 00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,075
 I feel like you're upset with me
 because you think...
 
 437
 00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,431
 ...that I'm up to something.
 
 438
 00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,357
 -Like what?
 -I have no idea, Skyler.
 
 439
 00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,632
 What, that I'm having an affair?
 Is that it? Is that what you think?
 
 440
 00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,796
 Is that why you asked me
 about the....
 
 441
 00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,231
 Some other phone? Because you think
 that I'm being unfaithful?
 
 442
 00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,111
 -I don't know.
 -Okay.
 
 443
 00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,117
 So ask me.
 
 444
 00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,959
 Why?
 
 445
 00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,352
 -Would you even tell me?
 -Yes. I would.
 
 446
 00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,312
 Of course, I would.
 
 447
 00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,548
 And no. I'm not.
 I'm not having an affair, okay?
 
 448
 00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,320
 Now, what do I do
 to prove that to you?
 
 449
 00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,830
 Swear an oath? My right hand
 to God. I'm not having an affair.
 
 450
 00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,758
 I heard you, Walt.
 
 451
 00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,991
 You're not having an affair.
 
 452
 00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,754
 Congratulations.
 
 453
 00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,269
 No, you know what?
 Congratulations to you, Skyler.
 
 454
 00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,515
 Great job.
 
 455
 00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,358
 What is this? What do I have to do?
 
 456
 00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,314
 -I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
 -Okay, so talk, Walt.
 
 457
 00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,952
 Shut up and say something
 that isn't complete bullshit.
 
 458
 00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,956
 You want to know
 what you have to do?
 
 459
 00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,039
 You have to tell me
 what's really going on right now.
 
 460
 00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,959
 Today. No more excuses.
 
 461
 00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,994
 No more apologies.
 No more of these—These obvious...
 
 462
 00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,668
 ...desperate breakfasts.
 
 463
 00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,992
 You don't wanna lose
 contact with me, Walt?
 
 464
 00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,679
 Good.
 
 465
 00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,677
 Then tell me.
 
 466
 00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,633
 Now.
 
 467
 00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,272
 Tell you what?
 
 468
 00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,518
 Skyler.
 
 469
 00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,391
 What is it you want me to tell you?
 I don't know.
 
 470
 00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,388
 We're not done here. Skyler.
 
 471
 00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,916
 Do you know what
 I've done for this family?
 
 472
 00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,839
 What the--?
 
 473
 00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,153
 -Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
 -What is wrong with you?
 
 474
 00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,749
 Why are you blue? Jesus.
 
 475
 00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,236
 I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
 with my parents being greedy...
 
 476
 00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,069
 -...kleptomaniac douche bags.
 -Are you actually this stupid?
 
 477
 00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,998
 No, look. I know this isn't a optimal—478
 00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,159
 To come to my house and park
 on my street, driving this vehicle.
 
 479
 00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,399
 I mean, what the hell is wrong
 with you? I'm really asking.
 
 480
 00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
 -Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
 -What if Skyler had seen you?
 
 481
 00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,393
 What then? What was the plan then,
 genius, huh?
 
 482
 00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,830
 -I don't know.
 -You know why you don't know?
 
 483
 00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,110
 Because you don't think. That's why.
 
 484
 00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,914
 You don't think.
 You never figured out how to think.
 
 485
 00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,635
 I said I was sorry. I just need
 my half of the money, and I will go.
 
 486
 00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,153
 Your half?
 
 487
 00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,749
 There is no your half of the money.
 
 488
 00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,394
 There is only my all of it.
 Do you understand?
 
 489
 00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,751
 Why should I be penalised
 because of your sloppiness?
 
 490
 00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,837

 Want some breakfast?
