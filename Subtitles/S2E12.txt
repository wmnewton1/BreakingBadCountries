 1
 00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,957
 Skyler, I'm so....
 
 2
 00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,789
 Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?
 
 3
 00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,352
 Oh, God. Oh, thank God.
 
 4
 00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,718
 Is she beautiful?
 
 5
 00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,200
 Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
 on the 40.
 
 6
 00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,913
 Some accident up ahead.
 
 7
 00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,917
 Christ! Today of all days, huh?
 
 8
 00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,875
 No, no, no. Let her rest.
 I'll be there as soon as I can.
 
 9
 00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,869
 Thank you.
 
 10
 00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,033
 Excuse me. Skyler White?
 
 11
 00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,595
 -307.
 -Thank you.
 
 12
 00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,835
 Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just....
 
 13
 00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,632
 Are you okay?
 
 14
 00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,915
 Meet your daughter.
 
 15
 00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,835
 Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.
 
 16
 00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,917
 Congratulations, Walt.
 
 17
 00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,669
 Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
 I didn't see you here.
 
 18
 00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,348
 Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.
 
 19
 00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,917
 I mean, this little bundle of joy
 of ours was practically on rails.
 
 20
 00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,554
 Halfway here I thought
 he was gonna have to pull over...
 
 21
 00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,512
 ...and deliver her himself.
 
 22
 00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,431
 Well, that—I'm glad it didn't come to that.
 
 23
 00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,429
 Yeah. Thanks, Ted.
 
 24
 00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,877
 No problem at all.
 
 25
 00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,755
 Well, let me get out of your way here
 so you two can—26
 00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,793
 You three can be alone, okay?
 
 27
 00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,514
 Listen, take it easy, Sky.
 
 28
 00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,237
 -I really can't begin to thank you.
 -Don't think anything of it.
 
 29
 00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,317
 It's my pleasure.
 Congratulations again.
 
 30
 00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,873
 -Thank you.
 -She's beautiful.
 
 31
 00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,513
 Okay. I'll talk to you soon.
 
 32
 00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,948
 Okay. Take care.
 
 33
 00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,354
 Bye.
 
 34
 00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,955
 Are you okay?
 
 35
 00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,912
 -Is everything okay?
 -Everything is okay.
 
 36
 00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,396
 I just wish you'd been here.
 
 37
 00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,309
 -Where's everyone else?
 -Downstairs.
 
 38
 00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,112
 Hank and Marie
 took Junior for dinner.
 
 39
 00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,359
 He has been such a trouper.
 He even changed his first diaper.
 
 40
 00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,391
 -No.
 -Yeah.
 
 41
 00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,833
 Did he?
 
 42
 00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,549
 Honey, is there anything
 that I can do for you?
 
 43
 00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,990
 -Anything at all?
 -Actually, yes.
 
 44
 00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,668
 I left my overnight bag
 at home this morning.
 
 45
 00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,474
 I just think you get it in your head,
 C-section. You know?
 
 46
 00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,309
 But I'm just so glad,
 the way it all worked out.
 
 47
 00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,754
 Doing it natural instead.
 
 48
 00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,110
 It just couldn't have gone any better.
 
 49
 00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,753
 Good.
 
 50
 00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,912
 Let me go get your things.
 
 51
 00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,309
 And I'll get my stuff too, okay?
 
 52
 00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,999
 -I'll spend the night.
 -Okay.
 
 53
 00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,399
 Dad.
 
 54
 00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,114
 I was in the shower, hey.
 
 55
 00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,071
 I overslept.
 
 56
 00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,869
 I'm running late, but I'll be there.
 
 57
 00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,553
 Yeah.
 
 58
 00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,632
 Baby, I gotta go.
 
 59
 00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,998
 Okay.
 
 60
 00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,678
 Somebody broke in.
 
 61
 00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,393
 Okay.
 
 62
 00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,596
 Oh, no. No, no, no!
 
 63
 00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,033
 Come on.
 
 64
 00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,038
 Damn.
 
 65
 00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,272
 Oh, God.
 
 66
 00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,437
 Oh, Christ.
 
 67
 00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,474
 This week was tough.
 
 68
 00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,033
 Toughest yet.
 
 69
 00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,277
 You know why?
 I knew this day was coming.
 
 70
 00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,755
 -My birthday.
 -Your re-birthday?
 
 71
 00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,871
 Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.
 
 72
 00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,832
 I was scared shitless
 I wouldn't make it.
 
 73
 00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,393
 I really didn't think I would.
 
 74
 00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,830
 Called in sick three days in a row.
 
 75
 00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,917
 I know my boss was pissed.
 
 76
 00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,998
 I guess I don't really care.
 I just didn't wanna see anybody.
 
 77
 00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,269
 You guys know how that is.
 
 78
 00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,313
 All it would take is one friend...
 
 79
 00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
 ...and I'd be out
 ripping and running again.
 
 80
 00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,316
 But I made it. I really made it.
 
 81
 00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,353
 I got one year clean to the day.
 
 82
 00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,035
 You look tired.
 Your eyes are kind of red.
 
 83
 00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,198
 -You getting enough sleep?
 -Actually, no.
 
 84
 00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,757
 I'm working on this
 really complex new tat.
 
 85
 00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,315
 -Yeah?
 -A guy wants his whole back done up.
 
 86
 00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,988
 Him on his chopper with, like,
 flames all around.
 
 87
 00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,510
 I keep showing him the design,
 he keeps asking for changes, like:
 
 88
 00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,631
 "Give me more muscles.
 Give me more flames."
 
 89
 00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,673
 And I'm like, "A:
 This ain't the Sistine Chapel.
 
 90
 00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,919
 And B: I have enough trouble
 working around your zits."
 
 91
 00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,470
 I really wish you wouldn't
 work at that place.
 
 92
 00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,477
 You need to avoid
 those type of people.
 
 93
 00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,513
 I know and I do.
 
 94
 00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,790
 It's mostly college kids
 and airmen from Kirtland.
 
 95
 00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,752
 It's actually really corporate.
 
 96
 00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,713
 Thank you.
 
 97
 00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,278
 So how's your job?
 
 98
 00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,277
 Oh, you know. Same old, same old.
 
 99
 00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,675
 Doing backup training
 on my days off.
 
 100
 00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,509
 God, they're hiring anybody now.
 I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.
 
 101
 00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,790
 You seeing anyone?
 
 102
 00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,319
 No.
 
 103
 00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,629
 You?
 
 104
 00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,316
 What about that guy next door?
 
 105
 00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,794
 What do you mean?
 
 106
 00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,230
 Well, he seemed to have
 some expectation...
 
 107
 00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,953
 ...of you introducing me to him.
 
 108
 00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,151
 He knows you own the place.
 
 109
 00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,919
 Yeah.
 
 110
 00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,389
 Dad, he's our tenant.
 
 111
 00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,348
 End of story.
 
 112
 00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,391
 Why would I get involved
 with a tenant?
 
 113
 00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,389
 Okay.
 
 114
 00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,038
 There you go.
 
 115
 00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,913
 Oh, yes.
 
 116
 00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,111
 Oh, isn't she beautiful?
 
 117
 00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,709
 I just think she's the most
 beautiful baby ever.
 
 118
 00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,195
 Yeah. And why not?
 
 119
 00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,072
 Good stock.
 
 120
 00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,359
 I'll get it.
 
 121
 00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,788
 Yeah. Yeah.
 
 122
 00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,673
 Hello. Hello?
 
 123
 00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,918
 Nobody's there.
 
 124
 00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,633
 Oh, well.
 
 125
 00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,278
 Beat you.
 
 126
 00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,718
 -Hello.
 -Hey, man.
 
 127
 00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,319
 ''Oh, hi, Carmen.''
 
 128
 00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,989
 Just Carmen.
 
 129
 00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,670
 -Come on. Hurry up.
 -So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.
 
 130
 00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,155
 ''Good news.''
 ''Oh, she's just so beautiful.''
 
 131
 00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,639
 Well, Holly.
 
 132
 00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,592
 ''Seven pounds, 3 ounces.''
 
 133
 00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,234
 Everybody is doing just fine.
 
 134
 00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
 You junkie imbecile.
 What are you calling this number for?
 
 135
 00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,316
 I am trying to tell you, man.
 
 136
 00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,318
 Last night,
 somebody broke in my place, yo.
 
 137
 00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,919
 -''I got robbed.''
 -What?
 
 138
 00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,432
 Yeah. Somebody,
 they got all of our stuff. Okay?
 
 139
 00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,278
 All of it.
 
 140
 00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,310
 You get me, Mr. White?
 
 141
 00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,511
 ''The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.''
 
 142
 00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,836
 They knew exactly where to look.
 
 143
 00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,511
 I mean, say something, man, all right?
 Yell at me or something! Come on!
 
 144
 00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,912
 ''Mr. White.''
 
 145
 00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,393
 God!
 
 146
 00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,952
 Oh, no.
 
 147
 00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,910
 Okay. Okay. Okay.
 
 148
 00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,840
 Hank, come on.
 People are starving to death out here.
 
 149
 00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,996
 All right. I just had to get a beer.
 
 150
 00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,679
 Finally.
 
 151
 00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,393
 All right, guys. Here we go.
 
 152
 00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,229
 We got mild, medium
 and ''muy caliente.''
 
 153
 00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,557
 I got dibs on the breast.
 
 154
 00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,752
 -Los Pollos Hermanos?
 -Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.
 
 155
 00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,111
 I think this joint gives KFC
 a run for their money.
 
 156
 00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,272
 That baby is hungry.
 
 157
 00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,799
 Give me that baby.
 
 158
 00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,036
 Oh, sweetie, yes.
 
 159
 00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,798
 Do you have any coleslaw in there?
 
 160
 00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,558
 Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.
 
 161
 00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,870
 -Not at the table. We're eating.
 -Hank, it's only a breast.
 
 162
 00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,038
 -It's my sister-in-law's breast.
 -Oh, you are so provincial.
 
 163
 00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,552
 Hank, remember the day...
 
 164
 00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,955
 ...when you were talking to me
 about childproofing?
 
 165
 00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,149
 Yeah.
 
 166
 00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,715
 Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
 A fence or a cover?
 
 167
 00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,515
 Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
 thinking more of an alarm system.
 
 168
 00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,508
 They've got these new systems that
 are now sonar systems that would—169
 00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,836
 Anything falls into it,
 it sets the alarm off.
 
 170
 00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,995
 Oh, nice.
 
 171
 00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,919
 -Wow, that sounds expensive.
 -Well, yeah.
 
 172
 00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,591
 -But for the baby, I mean....
 -Well, why don't....
 
 173
 00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,636
 Why don't you let Marie and I
 get that for you?
 
 174
 00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,149
 -Absolutely.
 -No, no. Thank you.
 
 175
 00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,749
 No, no, please.
 I'll be back at work soon.
 
 176
 00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,552
 We'll take care of it.
 
 177
 00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,557
 Back at work soon?
 
 178
 00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,197
 Since you're scheduled
 for surgery...
 
 179
 00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,473
 ...I just thought it might be a good
 idea to have some money coming in.
 
 180
 00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,909
 Well, Skyler, we need to think
 about what's best for the baby.
 
 181
 00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,033
 And I think having her mother around
 for at least the first few years....
 
 182
 00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,079
 Money-wise, we'll manage.
 I promise you that.
 
 183
 00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,750
 What? You guys got, like, a printing
 press in the garage churning out 50s?
 
 184
 00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,949
 I wish.
 
 185
 00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,071
 Mom's even talking
 about me getting a job.
 
 186
 00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,716
 That's right. Everybody pitches in.
 
 187
 00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,029
 Why don't we ever get Chinese?
 
 188
 00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,958
 I'll get her.
 
 189
 00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,118
 I'll get her.
 
 190
 00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,473
 Yes. Good girl.
 
 191
 00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,910
 That's a good girl.
 
 192
 00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,270
 My little girl, huh?
 
 193
 00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,070
 Hey, do you wanna see something?
 
 194
 00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,833
 Come here.
 
 195
 00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,715
 Oh, I know, I know.
 
 196
 00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,519
 Yeah.
 
 197
 00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,359
 Hey.
 
 198
 00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,033
 You wanna see what
 your daddy did for you?
 
 199
 00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,872
 Let me show you.
 
 200
 00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,796
 Here. Come here.
 
 201
 00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,713
 Wanna see?
 
 202
 00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,279
 That's right. Daddy did that.
 
 203
 00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,270
 Daddy did that for you.
 
 204
 00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,678
 This place looks exactly the same.
 
 205
 00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,077
 Why don't you have computers
 and shit? It's the 20th century.
 
 206
 00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,713
 What the hell are you doing here?
 
 207
 00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,831
 -Get out.
 -No. You took the stash.
 
 208
 00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,917
 I heard all those messages,
 figured it out.
 
 209
 00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,953
 You figured it out, huh?
 Well, congratulations, Einstein.
 
 210
 00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,755
 You left me to freak out all day long
 like I dropped the ball or something...
 
 211
 00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,350
 -...and you were the one who took it!
 -Shut up.
 
 212
 00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,070
 You lower your voice.
 
 213
 00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,636
 "Like you dropped the ball"?
 
 214
 00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,435
 When have you ever
 not dropped the ball, Jesse?
 
 215
 00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,029
 Blasted out of your mind
 on whatever the hell that was.
 
 216
 00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,312
 What was that, heroin?
 
 217
 00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,235
 Jesus.
 
 218
 00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,995
 I was on my day off, man.
 What I do on my day off—219
 00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,395
 "Day off"?
 We were on call, you junkie.
 
 220
 00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,591
 On call for the biggest deal
 of our lives.
 
 221
 00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,031
 I just managed to pull it off by the
 skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.
 
 222
 00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,153
 And you made me miss
 the birth of my daughter.
 
 223
 00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,714
 Son of a bitch.
 
 224
 00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,749
 How much?
 
 225
 00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,515
 -How much what?
 -How much did you get for the deal?
 
 226
 00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,876
 One-point-two million.
 
 227
 00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,398
 Six hundred thousand each.
 
 228
 00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,318
 Four hundred and eighty thousand.
 
 229
 00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,955
 Saul's cut is 20 percent.
 
 230
 00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,677
 All right.
 So where's my money?
 
 231
 00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,273
 What?
 
 232
 00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,190
 You are joking, right?
 
 233
 00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,110
 If I gave you that money...
 
 234
 00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,390
 ...you would be dead
 inside of a week.
 
 235
 00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,993
 Man, look, I'm off the heroin.
 
 236
 00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,431
 I didn't even like it anyway.
 It made me sick.
 
 237
 00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,471
 And the.... And the meth.
 
 238
 00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,878
 You know, I could take it or leave it.
 
 239
 00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,548
 I'm clean, Mr. White.
 
 240
 00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,273
 For real.
 
 241
 00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
 Prove it. Pee in that.
 
 242
 00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,039
 -How gay are you, seriously?
 -Pee in it.
 
 243
 00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,470
 They're selling testing kits
 at the drugstores.
 
 244
 00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,877
 If you are clean,
 I will give you every last dime.
 
 245
 00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,269
 No, huh?
 
 246
 00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,834
 Well, I guess, until then
 you'll just have to depend...
 
 247
 00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,873
 ...on the kindness of strangers
 to get high.
 
 248
 00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,753
 That and your little junkie girlfriend.
 
 249
 00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,913
 Not on her tummy, Walt.
 
 250
 00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,759
 I'm not putting her on her tummy.
 
 251
 00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,474
 I'll put her on her side.
 Do you wanna hold her back?
 
 252
 00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,352
 -Yeah.
 -Right there.
 
 253
 00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,949
 Just in case she decides
 to do a little spit-up...
 
 254
 00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,711
 ...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
 like this and put it under.
 
 255
 00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,870
 Hammacher Schlemmer
 makes a proper one of those.
 
 256
 00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,389
 -It's hypoallergenic.
 -Oh, yeah?
 
 257
 00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,798
 Well, I think a towel will do.
 
 258
 00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,158
 Skyler, what is it?
 
 259
 00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,193
 Your son. He is just unbelievable.
 Come see what he did.
 
 260
 00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,233
 -I told you it's not ready yet.
 -Honey, just show it to them.
 
 261
 00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,309
 My God, son. That's wonderful.
 
 262
 00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,873
 Flynn.
 
 263
 00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,355
 This is beautiful.
 
 264
 00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,793
 SaveWalterWhite.com.
 
 265
 00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,074
 Well, I, for one,
 am telling everybody.
 
 266
 00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,349
 Wait a minute. You're not asking
 for money, are you, son?
 
 267
 00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,437
 Yeah. That's the whole idea.
 
 268
 00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,632
 Louis helped me set up
 a PayPal account and everything.
 
 269
 00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,472
 -See?
 -But we can't ask for money.
 
 270
 00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,474
 Walt.
 
 271
 00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,513
 Okay.
 
 272
 00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,592
 I appreciate it. I really do.
 
 273
 00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,196
 Show me what else you put on.
 
 274
 00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,074
 This was all his idea.
 He worked so hard on it.
 
 275
 00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,191
 -Just let him help.
 -Skyler.
 
 276
 00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,109
 It's-- You can't ask him
 to take it down.
 
 277
 00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,074
 -It'll crush him.
 -Skyler, it's charity.
 
 278
 00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,076
 Why do you say that
 like it's some sort of dirty word?
 
 279
 00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,277
 This is insane.
 
 280
 00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,516
 I have so much cash on hand...
 
 281
 00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,473
 ...that I actually count it
 by weighing it on my bathroom scale.
 
 282
 00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,911
 And yet, I can't spend it.
 I can't tell my family about it.
 
 283
 00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,839
 All of whom think that I am
 right on the edge of bankruptcy.
 
 284
 00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,473
 I mean, it's--
 
 285
 00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,229
 It's insane.
 
 286
 00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,355
 Well, I guess that's why
 gangsters had molls.
 
 287
 00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,069
 What?
 
 288
 00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,708
 Gun molls.
 
 289
 00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,797
 Haven't you ever seen ''White Heat?''
 
 290
 00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,353
 Yeah, I've seen ''White Heat...''
 
 291
 00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,358
 -...but I don't see how that pertains.
 -Maybe you need a moll...
 
 292
 00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,120
 ...more than a wife
 who you can't trust with your secrets.
 
 293
 00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,799
 -Just--
 -What good is money...
 
 294
 00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,434
 ...that doesn't spend?
 The tree falls in the forest....
 
 295
 00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,030
 You know, you get the point.
 So communicating is out?
 
 296
 00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,508
 Out.
 
 297
 00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,039
 Let's see. What else is there?
 
 298
 00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,435
 There's always,
 "Hey, I found a big bag of money...
 
 299
 00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,312
 ...down by the railroad tracks."
 
 300
 00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,954
 No? No? Works for me.
 
 301
 00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,869
 Uncle Murray.
 
 302
 00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,074
 Oh, yeah.
 
 303
 00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,678
 Yeah,
 "Oh, many is the happy memory...
 
 304
 00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,711
 ...of Uncle Murray
 bouncing me on his knee.
 
 305
 00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,480
 We lost track of
 the old pervert years ago...
 
 306
 00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,752
 -...but he kicked it, left me millions."
 -No, no.
 
 307
 00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,988
 It cannot be blind luck or some
 imaginary relative who saves us.
 
 308
 00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,634
 No, I earned that money, me.
 
 309
 00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,231
 And now my son created
 his own website...
 
 310
 00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,274
 ...SaveWalterWhite.com,
 soliciting anonymous donations.
 
 311
 00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,995
 Do you have any idea
 how that makes me feel?
 
 312
 00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,991
 Yeah, look at that.
 It's got PayPal and everything.
 
 313
 00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,351
 Cyber-begging. That's all that is.
 
 314
 00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,552
 Just rattling a little tin cup
 to the entire world.
 
 315
 00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,228
 Yeah, there's no deep-seated
 issues there.
 
 316
 00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,477
 Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
 It's staring me in the face.
 
 317
 00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,353
 -Do I have to spell it out for you?
 -I know. I know.
 
 318
 00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,755
 You're thinking that I should be
 funnelling money...
 
 319
 00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,996
 ...into my son's website,
 but absolutely not.
 
 320
 00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,714
 I am not going to have
 my family think that some...
 
 321
 00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,990
 ...mystery benefactor saved us.
 
 322
 00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,033
 Not some mystery benefactor,
 singular.
 
 323
 00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,470
 That would raise too many questions.
 However—324
 00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,636
 Stay with me here.
 
 325
 00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,319—zombies.
 
 326
 00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,111
 I got a guy, who knows this guy,
 who knows this ''Rain Man''-type.
 
 327
 00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,551
 He lives with his mother
 in her basement in Belarus, all right?
 
 328
 00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,558
 So good luck extraditing
 his fat Russian ass.
 
 329
 00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,036
 Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
 extraordinaire.
 
 330
 00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,754
 This guy can hijack
 random desktops...
 
 331
 00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,475
 ...all around the world, turn them
 into zombies that do his bidding.
 
 332
 00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,958
 For instance, he can make it
 so 20- or 30,000...
 
 333
 00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,357
 ...little donations come in
 from all over the U.S. and Canada.
 
 334
 00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,516
 Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...
 
 335
 00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,837
 ...all paid in full, nice and neat,
 untraceable...
 
 336
 00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,794
 ...from the good-hearted people
 of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...
 
 337
 00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,036
 ...cancer saint.
 
 338
 00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,755
 I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
 just thinking about it.
 
 339
 00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,875
 He's an asshole, that's what.
 Always judging me.
 
 340
 00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,279
 Not too much.
 
 341
 00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,835
 I mean, like, who is he, right?
 
 342
 00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,634
 I mean, first off, I taught him.
 
 343
 00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,752
 Always acting like
 I'm his indentured servant.
 
 344
 00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,838
 Now the cotton.
 
 345
 00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,469
 Needle?
 
 346
 00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,592
 -I don't understand why you need him.
 -Exactly.
 
 347
 00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,236
 My point exactly.
 
 348
 00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,236
 Flat against your skin
 so it doesn't wiggle around too much.
 
 349
 00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,916
 How much does he owe you,
 anyway?
 
 350
 00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,470
 Four hundred and eighty.
 
 351
 00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,871
 Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
 if somebody owed me 500 bucks.
 
 352
 00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,196
 No, no.
 
 353
 00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,638
 Four hundred and eighty thousand.
 
 354
 00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,515
 What?
 
 355
 00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,873
 What?
 
 356
 00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,032
 Thousand.
 
 357
 00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,798
 Not on your back,
 in case you throw up.
 
 358
 00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,151
 On your side. Sleep on your side.
 
 359
 00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,109
 And she's all like:
 
 360
 00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,710
 "Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
 "Baby, I'm not preaching to you.
 
 361
 00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,480
 I'm talking about basic survival,
 you know?
 
 362
 00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,399
 I'm conversing
 about life and death."
 
 363
 00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,194
 I mean, this here,
 what we've been doing...
 
 364
 00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,356
 ...hell, Becky knows.
 
 365
 00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,273
 Dad?
 
 366
 00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,550
 I overslept. I'm on my way.
 
 367
 00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,759
 Dad?
 
 368
 00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,635
 Dad, wait.
 
 369
 00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,195
 Dad, it's not what it looks like.
 
 370
 00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,439
 Dad.
 
 371
 00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,793
 Dad, will just wait? Let me—Just talk to you for one second.
 
 372
 00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,035
 No, Dad.
 
 373
 00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,435
 Dad, come on.
 
 374
 00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,239
 Dad?
 
 375
 00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,558
 Dad, no. No, stop it!
 Don't touch him, Dad!
 
 376
 00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,990
 -Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
 -Son of a bitch.
 
 377
 00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,591
 Dad, no. Stop it!
 Stop it, Dad! Stop it!
 
 378
 00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,519
 -Get away from me, man. Back off.
 -Jesse.
 
 379
 00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,709
 -Jesse, no!
 -Back off!
 
 380
 00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,514
 -Okay, everybody just calm down!
 -What's with you, yo?
 
 381
 00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,871
 -Because I'll seriously bust you up.
 -You miserable little smackhead.
 
 382
 00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,071
 -Get the hell out!
 -Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!
 
 383
 00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,679
 All right? I got civil rights.
 
 384
 00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,553
 Dad, no! Okay!
 
 385
 00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,149
 Jesse, come on.
 Please, no. Come on.
 
 386
 00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,035
 I pay my rent.
 
 387
 00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,029
 You're going back to rehab.
 Today. Now.
 
 388
 00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,515
 Look, as it so happens,
 we were just....
 
 389
 00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,278
 We were just talking
 about that now.
 
 390
 00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,596
 -Yeah?
 -Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?
 
 391
 00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,155
 -If you would just let me.
 -Eighteen months.
 
 392
 00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,636
 You have been clean for 18 months,
 Jane. Why? Why do you do it?
 
 393
 00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,878
 I backslid, okay?
 
 394
 00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,748
 Like, what?
 
 395
 00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,871
 What, you think I'm proud of this?
 
 396
 00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,832
 Like I do it on purpose?
 
 397
 00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,393
 Lying to me...
 
 398
 00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,433
 ...shacking up and using
 with this scumbag, this loser.
 
 399
 00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,755
 It takes one to know one.
 
 400
 00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,758
 His name is Jesse. You don't know
 the first thing about him.
 
 401
 00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,474
 We talk about rehab every night.
 It's his idea.
 
 402
 00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,433
 You talk about rehab?
 Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?
 
 403
 00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,318
 Thank you for not being judgemental
 24 hours a day.
 
 404
 00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,229
 Because that's exactly what I need,
 to be judged all the time!
 
 405
 00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,189
 Okay.
 
 406
 00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,630
 You know what you need?
 I'll tell you what you need.
 
 407
 00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,829
 What are you doing?
 
 408
 00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,554
 -What are you doing?
 -I am calling the police.
 
 409
 00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,391
 -Dad. Dad, no, don't.
 -Come on. Come on!
 
 410
 00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,556
 -Dad, no. Don't.
 -I have tried 10 years...
 
 411
 00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,193
 ...of love and understanding.
 
 412
 00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,392
 Maybe what it takes
 is you drying out in a jail cell.
 
 413
 00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,919
 Dad, no.
 
 414
 00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,351
 Yes, I would like to report drug use
 in a building that I own.
 
 415
 00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,677
 -Dad. Daddy, no.
 -No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.
 
 416
 00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,552
 -I'd like to talk to somebody.
 -Daddy.
 
 417
 00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,274
 -Would you connect me, please?
 -Fine, we'll go to rehab.
 
 418
 00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,436
 I could care less
 about him going to rehab.
 
 419
 00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,949
 -I want you in rehab.
 -I'll go first thing tomorrow.
 
 420
 00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,798
 Not tomorrow. Today.
 
 421
 00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,117
 I have to call into work.
 I have to stop the newspaper.
 
 422
 00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,108
 The last time I went, my houseplants
 died because you didn't water them.
 
 423
 00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,472
 Daddy, please?
 
 424
 00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,829
 I'll go.
 
 425
 00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,474
 ''Albuquerque Police.''
 ''How may I direct your call?''
 
 426
 00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,873
 Tomorrow.
 
 427
 00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,674
 ''Hello?''
 
 428
 00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,353
 ''Hello?''
 
 429
 00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,239
 I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
 
 430
 00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,629
 Tomorrow.
 
 431
 00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,152
 You meant all that?
 
 432
 00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,393
 I don't know.
 
 433
 00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,874
 I just think
 if we had enough money...
 
 434
 00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,234
 ...nobody could make us
 do anything.
 
 435
 00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,833
 Oh, just let it ring.
 
 436
 00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,395
 No, I'm gonna go see who it is.
 
 437
 00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,158
 It's okay, Holly.
 
 438
 00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,476
 It's okay, sweetie.
 
 439
 00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,309
 Good luck with that.
 
 440
 00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,910
 But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
 you know, write some—441
 00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,636
 You know, actually, here he is
 right now. So hold on a second.
 
 442
 00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,872
 -What?
 -It's one of your....
 
 443
 00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,914
 One of your old students
 wants a letter of recommendation.
 
 444
 00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,318
 Oh, okay. Thanks.
 
 445
 00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,512
 Oh, honey,
 I think the baby is getting hungry.
 
 446
 00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,757
 -This is Walter White.
 -''Hello, Walter White.''
 
 447
 00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,069
 I'm sorry.
 I'm having a little trouble recalling—448
 00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,713
 It's Jane.
 
 449
 00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,751
 You know, of Jesse and Jane.
 
 450
 00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,154
 ''Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."''
 
 451
 00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,195
 Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
 It really has been a long time.
 
 452
 00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,879
 Get somewhere
 where you can talk.
 
 453
 00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,551
 Sure. Yes.
 I am looking into that as we speak.
 
 454
 00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,317
 How the hell did you get this number?
 Did Jesse give it to you?
 
 455
 00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,159
 All Jesse wants
 is what's coming to him.
 
 456
 00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,793
 No more, no less.
 
 457
 00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,399
 ''What are you talking about?''
 
 458
 00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,158
 Four hundred and eighty thousand.
 
 459
 00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,635
 -He told you about the money.
 -''He told me everything.''
 
 460
 00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,558
 So, what is this?
 
 461
 00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,236
 What, some kind of blackmail
 or something?
 
 462
 00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,317
 This is me telling you
 to do right by Jesse.
 
 463
 00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,919
 Bring him what you owe him.
 
 464
 00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,473
 ''I don't call that blackmail.''
 
 465
 00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,717
 ''I call that you getting off your ass,''
 ''and being a decent human being.''
 
 466
 00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,399
 Well, I call it blackmail.
 
 467
 00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,195
 Dialling my number.
 Talking to my wife.
 
 468
 00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,359
 And what's your end of this?
 
 469
 00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,757
 How much heroin
 does a half a million dollars buy?
 
 470
 00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,760
 For your information,
 I am holding Jesse's money for him...
 
 471
 00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,996
 ''...and he will receive''
 ''every last dollar of it.''
 
 472
 00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,599
 He will, not you...
 
 473
 00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,358
 ...at a time when I see fit.
 
 474
 00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,915
 But I will not contribute
 to his overdose.
 
 475
 00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,710
 ''Now you tell him, if he gets clean--''
 
 476
 00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,831
 -If you both get clean--
 -''You know what?''
 
 477
 00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,632
 I take that back. This is blackmail.
 
 478
 00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,115
 Because what I know about you,
 high-school teacher...
 
 479
 00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,834
 ''...turned drug dealer,''
 ''with a brother-in-law in the DEA...''
 
 480
 00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,112
 ''...that would make one hell of a story.''
 ''National news, I'll bet.''
 
 481
 00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,835
 Do right by Jesse tonight
 or I will burn you to the ground.
 
 482
 00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,549
 Shit.
 
 483
 00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,918
 He's a high-school teacher. What's
 he gonna do, give you a B-minus?
 
 484
 00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,634
 Send you outside
 to clap the erasers?
 
 485
 00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,352
 You wouldn't really go to the cops,
 would you?
 
 486
 00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,637
 We won't have to. He'll pay.
 
 487
 00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,114
 And what if he doesn't?
 
 488
 00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,117
 Jesse, it's your money.
 
 489
 00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,598
 You're in the right here. He's in
 the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.
 
 490
 00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,678
 What is it, really?
 
 491
 00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,155
 You don't want
 your half a million dollars?
 
 492
 00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,750
 You wanna renounce your earthly
 possessions and become a monk?
 
 493
 00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,235
 No, it's just,
 I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.
 
 494
 00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,557
 And by extension, you know,
 neither are you.
 
 495
 00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,230
 I mean, he's my partner.
 
 496
 00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,992
 I'm your partner.
 
 497
 00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,951
 ''The largest land animal''
 ''in all the planet...''
 
 498
 00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,720
 ''...lives in a tightly knit''
 ''matriarchal society...''
 
 499
 00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,911
 ''...led by the eldest female''
 ''in the herd.''
 
 500
 00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,712
 ''Close your eyes and go to sleep.''
 
 501
 00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,714
 She is finally asleep.
 
 502
 00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,995
 What you doing,
 learning about elephants?
 
 503
 00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,398
 Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
 Would you mind going out?
 
 504
 00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,633
 Jesse.
 
 505
 00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,753
 Not you.
 
 506
 00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,071
 Nice job wearing the pants.
 
 507
 00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,076
 How do I know she'll keep quiet?
 
 508
 00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,556
 I guess you don't.
 
 509
 00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,879
 You'll never hear
 from either of us again.
 
 510
 00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,639
 You're not seeing straight, Jesse.
 
 511
 00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,713
 You are making a mistake.
 
 512
 00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,679
 -Do you know what this is?
 -It's a whole lot of cheddar.
 
 513
 00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,393
 This is freedom.
 
 514
 00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,319
 This is saying,
 "I can go anywhere I want.
 
 515
 00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,715
 I can be anybody."
 
 516
 00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,319
 Who do you wanna be?
 
 517
 00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,512
 Where do you wanna go?
 South America? Europe? Australia?
 
 518
 00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,871
 -Is New Zealand part of Australia?
 -New Zealand is New Zealand.
 
 519
 00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,115
 Right on.
 
 520
 00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,357
 New Zealand. That's where
 they made ''Lord of the Rings.''
 
 521
 00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,313
 I say we just move there, yo.
 I mean, you can do your art.
 
 522
 00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,159
 Right? Like, you can paint, like,
 the local castles and shit.
 
 523
 00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,351
 And I can be a bush pilot.
 
 524
 00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,028
 Yeah. New Zealand.
 I can get behind that.
 
 525
 00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,153
 But I guess I'm good anywhere
 as long as it's the two of us.
 
 526
 00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,712
 But first, we gotta get clean.
 
 527
 00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,797
 And not because
 anybody is telling us to.
 
 528
 00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,710
 -We do this for us, right?
 -Yeah. Absolutely. For us.
 
 529
 00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,753
 All this here, we're not gonna
 just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.
 
 530
 00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,949
 We're not.
 
 531
 00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,549
 Hell, no. No, no, no.
 We're better than that.
 
 532
 00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,274
 We're way better than that. I say....
 
 533
 00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,155
 I say we flush what we've got left
 and we start tonight.
 
 534
 00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,351
 Yeah, we can do that.
 
 535
 00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,558
 Definitely.
 
 536
 00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,318
 Excuse me.
 
 537
 00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,238
 What can I get you?
 
 538
 00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,272
 Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.
 
 539
 00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,713
 Damn it.
 
 540
 00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,072
 Hey, honey.
 
 541
 00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,830
 No. I don't know what to tell you.
 
 542
 00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,158
 Three stores I've been to so far,
 and not one of them have it in stock.
 
 543
 00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,911
 Well, do they have
 to be diapers for newborns?
 
 544
 00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,873
 What if we went up a size
 and just kind of....
 
 545
 00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,591
 All right, all right. No, I understand.
 
 546
 00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,678
 All right. No, I'll just keep looking.
 
 547
 00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,395
 I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so....
 
 548
 00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,234
 Yeah. Okay. Love you.
 
 549
 00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,998
 Thank you.
 
 550
 00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,152
 God.
 
 551
 00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,232
 Well played.
 
 552
 00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,631
 They found water on Mars.
 
 553
 00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,955
 They have indeed.
 
 554
 00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,511
 Don't know what to do
 with that information...
 
 555
 00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,075
 ...but, hey, God bless them,
 they found it.
 
 556
 00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,355
 Oh, well, actually...
 
 557
 00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,076
 ...they theoretically can separate
 the hydrogen from the oxygen...
 
 558
 00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,319
 ...and process that into providing
 fuel for manned space flights.
 
 559
 00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,672
 Ostensibly, turning Mars into
 a giant gas station.
 
 560
 00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,598
 So it's a....
 
 561
 00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,234
 Yeah. We live in an amazing time.
 
 562
 00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,151
 -To water on Mars.
 -To water on Mars.
 
 563
 00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,072
 So, what did you have? Girl or boy?
 
 564
 00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,476
 -Little girl.
 -That's nice.
 
 565
 00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,829
 -Thanks.
 -Congratulations.
 
 566
 00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,029
 Thank you.
 
 567
 00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,595
 -I have a daughter.
 -Yeah?
 
 568
 00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,353
 How old?
 
 569
 00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,959
 Old enough to know better.
 
 570
 00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,671
 Twenty-seven next month.
 
 571
 00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,231
 -You have other kids?
 -Just the one.
 
 572
 00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,679
 I've got a 16-year-old boy.
 Well, he's almost 16.
 
 573
 00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,835
 Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?
 
 574
 00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,312
 But he helps out, though.
 
 575
 00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,273
 He's even changing some diapers
 now, so....
 
 576
 00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,552
 It's more than I managed to do
 when I was his age.
 
 577
 00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,193
 Kids today grow up faster, I think.
 
 578
 00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,518
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.
 
 579
 00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,952
 So, any advice?
 
 580
 00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,638
 Having a daughter. Any advice?
 
 581
 00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,273
 No, not really. Just love them.
 
 582
 00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,038
 Just—Yeah.
 
 583
 00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,630
 I mean, they are who they are.
 
 584
 00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,753
 Yeah.
 
 585
 00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,839
 I've got this nephew.
 
 586
 00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,876
 This nephew who is—I mean, he's an adult.
 
 587
 00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,154
 But you can't infantilize them,
 you can't live their life for them.
 
 588
 00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,070
 But still, I mean,
 there is that frustration.
 
 589
 00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,713
 You know, that....
 
 590
 00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,151
 God, that frustration
 that goes along with, you know:
 
 591
 00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,239
 "Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
 what is best for you, so listen."
 
 592
 00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,351
 But of course, they don't.
 
 593
 00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,948
 I mean, what do you do
 with someone like that?
 
 594
 00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,953
 Family?
 
 595
 00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,076
 Yeah. Family.
 
 596
 00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,149
 You can't give up on them. Never.
 
 597
 00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,272
 I mean, what else is there?
 
 598
 00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,114
 Jesse, it's me.
 
 599
 00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,996
 Jesse, I just wanna talk.
 
 600
 00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,837
 Jesus.
 
 601
 00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,999
 Jesse.
 
 602
 00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,319
 Jesse.
 
 603
 00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,430
 Jesse, wake up.
 
 604
 00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,154
 Jesse, wake up.
 
 605
 00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,638
 No, no, no.
