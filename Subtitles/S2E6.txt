 1
 00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,554
 -Yo.
 -Yo.
 
 2
 00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,954
 What up?
 
 3
 00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,229
 Damn, bitch.
 
 4
 00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,509
 -You got something for me?
 -Yeah. Yeah, I found them.
 
 5
 00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,316
 -Is this a five or an S?
 -Five, yo.
 
 6
 00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,317
 No, wait. S.
 
 7
 00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,229
 -No, no. Yeah, five.
 -Yeah?
 
 8
 00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,195
 Jesus, how the hell do you spell
 "street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?
 
 9
 00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,389
 Hey, man.
 
 10
 00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,512
 I'm slinging mad volume
 and fat stacking Benjies.
 
 11
 00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,359
 I can't be all about,
 like, spelling and shit.
 
 12
 00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,993
 Hey.
 
 13
 00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,838
 So they got names?
 
 14
 00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,113
 Hers is, like, I don't know.
 She's just his woman is all.
 
 15
 00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,117
 Him, they call Spooge.
 
 16
 00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,319
 Spooge?
 Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?
 
 17
 00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,351
 Let me get this straight.
 You got jacked...
 
 18
 00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,437
 ...by a guy named Spooge?
 
 19
 00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,198
 Yo, what's his name matter?
 
 20
 00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,836
 All's I saw was that knife
 he stuck in my face, like that big.
 
 21
 00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,554
 If you're looking for a reason
 not to go do this thing....
 
 22
 00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,830
 -Did I say that?
 -Because I'll go do it myself.
 
 23
 00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,158
 -It's just I'm on probation and all.
 -Yeah.
 
 24
 00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,911
 So you gonna do it?
 
 25
 00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,319
 Yeah.
 
 26
 00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,670
 Good. Right on.
 
 27
 00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,839
 Because these two,
 they need to get got.
 
 28
 00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,397
 Where's my money, bitch?
 Where's my money?
 
 29
 00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,397
 Where's my--?
 
 30
 00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,230
 Where's my money, bitch?
 Huh, bitch?
 
 31
 00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,432
 Where's my money, bitch?
 Oh, that's good.
 
 32
 00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,153
 Where's my money?
 
 33
 00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,669
 Where's my money, bitch?
 Bitch, where's my money?
 
 34
 00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,916
 Come on.
 
 35
 00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,479
 I will mess you up.
 
 36
 00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,513
 That how you wanna play this?
 Your call.
 
 37
 00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,154
 Your funeral, jack.
 
 38
 00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,912
 Hey, do not mess with me.
 I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.
 
 39
 00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,793
 Yeah, ''mucho loco.''
 
 40
 00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,992
 Do not test me.
 
 41
 00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
 -Good morning.
 -Good morning.
 
 42
 00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,479
 Honey, you blocking the mailbox.
 
 43
 00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,829
 Yeah, sorry. Sorry.
 
 44
 00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,508
 Looks like it's gonna be
 a nice day, huh?
 
 45
 00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,632
 Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.
 
 46
 00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,799
 -You have a great day.
 -Right on. You too.
 
 47
 00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,712
 God. Shit.
 
 48
 00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,431
 Yo, anybody home?
 
 49
 00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,029
 Hello?
 
 50
 00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,871
 ''Tonight, you will receive''
 ''the ultimate mixture of cutlery...''
 
 51
 00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,230
 ''...tonight in the steel knock out.''
 
 52
 00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,238
 ''Every phone line jammed.''
 ''Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.''
 
 53
 00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,670
 ''That's 15 easy instalments.''
 
 54
 00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,758
 ''And, folks, the knock out is only--''
 
 55
 00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
 Hey, yo, is anybody else home?
 
 56
 00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,268
 ''Now, Terry put this one together--''
 
 57
 00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,948
 Where's your folks? They here?
 
 58
 00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,991
 ''--and I'm here to tell you--''
 
 59
 00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,149
 ''Yeah, guys,''
 ''you might wanna put up like a....''
 
 60
 00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,114
 ''Already done it.''
 
 61
 00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,356
 ''Tonight, folks....''
 
 62
 00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,277
 ''Do you realise how long it's been...''
 
 63
 00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,871
 ''...since we've offered this sword''
 ''in this set?''
 
 64
 00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,155
 ''Much less the watashi and tanto''
 ''as a bonus in the deal.''
 
 65
 00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,952
 ''It's no wonder--''
 
 66
 00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,118
 ''It is no wonder so many of you''
 ''are on the line right now--''
 
 67
 00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,389
 What's your name?
 
 68
 00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,751
 ''I'm gonna count this as one.''
 ''Even though there are three, I'm--''
 
 69
 00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,270
 My name's Diesel.
 
 70
 00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,357
 ''--eleven, 12, 13--''
 
 71
 00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,518
 ''--sixteen, 17, 18, 19....''
 
 72
 00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,154
 Yo, don't you wanna watch
 something other than this?
 
 73
 00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,830
 Like, I don't know, ''Mister Rogers'?''
 
 74
 00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,033
 ''Imagine this plan,''
 ''this set in your own home.''
 
 75
 00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,073
 ''Folks, custom pieces--''
 
 76
 00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,319
 ''Well, needless to say,''
 ''I've made a pretty good mess...''
 
 77
 00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,670
 ''...but there's a reason for that.''
 
 78
 00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,908
 ''Just because these are under $10,''
 ''don't let anybody kid you.''
 
 79
 00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,590
 ''These knives possess edges like....''
 
 80
 00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,152
 So when are your folks
 coming home?
 
 81
 00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,558
 Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
 When is he getting back?
 
 82
 00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,190
 I'm hungry.
 
 83
 00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,078
 ''Hey there, you three.''
 
 84
 00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,953
 ''Just wanted to wish Walt''
 ''a good first day back.''
 
 85
 00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,915
 ''We'll be thinking about you''
 ''teaching valences and covalences....''
 
 86
 00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,112
 ''Okay, that's all I officially''
 ''remembered. Good luck.''
 
 87
 00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,039
 ''Skyler, give me a call''
 ''when you get a chance.''
 
 88
 00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,833
 ''Hi, Walt and Skyler.''
 ''This is Gretchen Schwartz...''
 
 89
 00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,996
 ''...calling to say hello.''
 
 90
 00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,192
 ''I'm down from Santa Fe today''
 ''and I was thinking about you both...''
 
 91
 00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,594
 ''...hoping everything's well.''
 
 92
 00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,758
 ''I tried Walt's cell, and it said''
 ''the number had been disconnected...''
 
 93
 00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,349
 ''...so I'm just hoping''
 ''that everything's okay.''
 
 94
 00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,630
 ''Call me if you can,''
 ''whenever's convenient.''
 
 95
 00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,276
 -Hello?
 ''-Oh, hi, Gretchen.''
 
 96
 00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,790
 ''This is Skyler White.''
 ''Am I catching you at a bad time?''
 
 97
 00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,036
 No. No, not at all.
 
 98
 00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,595
 It's so good to hear from you.
 How is everybody?
 
 99
 00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,119
 ''We're very well, thank you.''
 
 100
 00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,635
 Walt is actually at work today.
 It's his first day back at work...
 
 101
 00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,037
 ''...and he lost his cell phone''
 ''quite a while back.''
 
 102
 00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,037
 And I really hope
 we didn't worry you.
 
 103
 00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,073
 No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
 that everybody's fine.
 
 104
 00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,599
 That's wonderful.
 
 105
 00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,430
 Gretchen, I'm so very,
 very long overdue in telling you this...
 
 106
 00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,394
 ...and I have to take Walt at his word
 that he's been passing it along for me.
 
 107
 00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,750
 ''I mean, he's been so adamant...''
 
 108
 00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,475
 ...about wanting to handle this
 whole thing by himself, and....
 
 109
 00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,353
 But I have picked up the phone
 about a hundred times. I justâ€”110
 00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,756
 -What? What is it?
 ''-I can't...''
 
 111
 00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,316
 ...begin to thank you and Elliott
 for what you've done.
 
 112
 00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,598
 ''The money for Walt's treatment,''
 ''it's just....''
 
 113
 00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,271
 It saved us.
 
 114
 00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
 I don't know if I....
 
 115
 00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,999
 Walt keeps saying,
 "Don't bother them. It's no big deal."
 
 116
 00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,316
 But it is a big deal. Yeah.
 
 117
 00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,830
 To me. And to all of us.
 
 118
 00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
 So I just...
 
 119
 00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,873
 ...finally wanted to say thank you.
 
 120
 00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,633
 ''Anyway....''
 
 121
 00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,155
 End of speech.
 
 122
 00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,920
 So I doâ€”I hope we get to see you soon.
 
 123
 00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,796
 Truly, anytime you're in town,
 anytime at all, is good for us.
 
 124
 00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,639
 -How about this afternoon?
 ''-Yeah, okay.''
 
 125
 00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,671
 Monoalkenes, diolefins...
 
 126
 00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,316
 ...trienes, polyenes.
 
 127
 00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,830
 I mean, the nomenclature alone
 is enough to make your head spin.
 
 128
 00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,996
 But when you start
 to feel overwhelmed...
 
 129
 00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,350
 ...and you will...
 
 130
 00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,519
 ...just keep in mind
 that one element...
 
 131
 00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,870
 ...carbon.
 
 132
 00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,436
 Carbon is at the centre of it all.
 
 133
 00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,235
 There is no life without carbon.
 
 134
 00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,829
 Nowhere that we know of
 in the universe.
 
 135
 00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,673
 Everything that lives, lived,
 will live, carbon.
 
 136
 00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,395
 Carmen is carbon.
 
 137
 00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,358
 Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
 Did you...?
 
 138
 00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,437
 No. Okay.
 
 139
 00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,910
 I like to think of it....
 
 140
 00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,230
 I like to think that the diamond...
 
 141
 00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,396
 ...and the woman
 who wears it on her finger...
 
 142
 00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,672
 ...are both formed
 from the same stuff.
 
 143
 00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,590
 Or, say, the diamond
 and the man who invented it.
 
 144
 00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,990
 That got your attention, right?
 
 145
 00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,749
 The man who invented the diamond.
 All right.
 
 146
 00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,828
 H. Tracy Hall.
 Write this name down.
 
 147
 00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,754
 Dr. Hall invented
 the first reproducible process...
 
 148
 00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,269
 ..for making synthetic diamonds.
 
 149
 00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,550
 I mean, this is way back in the '50s.
 
 150
 00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,709
 Now, today, synthetic diamonds
 are used in oil drilling...
 
 151
 00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,436
 ...electronics,
 multi-billion-dollar industries.
 
 152
 00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,076
 At the time, Dr. Hall
 worked for General Electric.
 
 153
 00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,035
 And he made them a fortune.
 I mean, incalculable.
 
 154
 00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,152
 You wanna know
 how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?
 
 155
 00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,428
 A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.
 
 156
 00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,038
 Anyway....
 
 157
 00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,196
 A savings bond
 printed on carbon-based paper...
 
 158
 00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,879
 ...paid to a carbon-based man....
 
 159
 00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,518
 ...for something
 he made out of carbon.
 
 160
 00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,072
 ''It's so nice to have you back with us.''
 
 161
 00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,954
 You're looking great, by the way.
 
 162
 00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,472
 A little skinnier,
 which is definitely no tragedy.
 
 163
 00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,797
 -And then there's the hair thing.
 -I actually like that.
 
 164
 00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,195
 That's a great look for you.
 
 165
 00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,311
 -But you're feeling good?
 -Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.
 
 166
 00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,590
 It's....
 
 167
 00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,199
 I'm glad to be back at work.
 
 168
 00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,076
 I'm glad to.... You know,
 I'm happy to be here. Really.
 
 169
 00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,191
 We're happy too.
 
 170
 00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,915
 And I just....
 
 171
 00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,838
 Yeah. It's good. It's great.
 
 172
 00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,596
 Is everything okay?
 
 173
 00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,714
 Just please feel comfortable
 coming to me...
 
 174
 00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,471
 ...with any problems, any issues.
 Anything at all.
 
 175
 00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,478
 You know, completely confidential.
 
 176
 00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,511
 Okay?
 
 177
 00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,471
 -See you tomorrow, Flynn.
 -See you, Jeffrey.
 
 178
 00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,075
 Oh, man.
 
 179
 00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,912
 Let me see it.
 
 180
 00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,790
 -Dad, let me see it.
 -Don't worry about it.
 
 181
 00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,078
 Hey, let's go.
 
 182
 00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,671
 ''Forty-eight dollars,''
 ''that's the original price....''
 
 183
 00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,869
 Hey.
 
 184
 00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,828
 Peekaboo.
 
 185
 00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,155
 No?
 
 186
 00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,313
 Peekaboo.
 
 187
 00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,668
 Oh, man.
 
 188
 00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,632
 Oh, my hand is cramping up!
 
 189
 00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,514
 Oh, my God. Here, here, here.
 
 190
 00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,959
 Now, I don't know.
 If you want your hand to stop aching...
 
 191
 00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,913
 ...I gave you advice,
 take it or leave it.
 
 192
 00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,790
 Okay, you stay right here, all right?
 Okay? I mean it.
 
 193
 00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,149
 -Shut up!
 -You shut up.
 
 194
 00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,669
 -You shut up, you--
 -You shut up!
 
 195
 00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,474
 -You're the one who dropped it.
 -I didn't drop it.
 
 196
 00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,635
 I didn't dropâ€”197
 00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,956
 -Shit! You dropped it.
 -Shut the hell up about it.
 
 198
 00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,479
 -You shut up!
 -You shut up.
 
 199
 00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,919
 Get up.
 
 200
 00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,349
 Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.
 
 201
 00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,032
 -You know who might have done it?
 -I have an idea.
 
 202
 00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,190
 Well, here's what I think.
 
 203
 00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,678
 You ID them, and then together,
 you and I put a bag over their heads...
 
 204
 00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,829
 ...we tie them up, drive them way out
 into the desert, strip them naked...
 
 205
 00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,194
 ...then bury them up to their necks
 in a huge mound of fire ants.
 
 206
 00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,715
 Saw it in an old Western.
 
 207
 00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,592
 You with me?
 
 208
 00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,510
 Scorpions?
 
 209
 00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,474
 Scorpions are good.
 
 210
 00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,677
 Yeah.
 
 211
 00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,194
 Nice.
 
 212
 00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,154
 Damn, Dad. Check it out.
 
 213
 00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,828
 Who is this?
 
 214
 00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,833
 So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.
 
 215
 00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,076
 He likes to go by Flynn these days.
 
 216
 00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,555
 -Mom.
 -What? I'm just offering the choice.
 
 217
 00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,149
 This is Mrs. Schwartz,
 whom you've heard so much about.
 
 218
 00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,193
 -Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
 -Nice to meet you too.
 
 219
 00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,515
 Oh, Walt.
 
 220
 00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,992
 Look who's here.
 
 221
 00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,155
 -Gretchen.
 -Hi.
 
 222
 00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,272
 Always nice to see you.
 What a nice surprise.
 
 223
 00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,914
 Look at you. You're looking good.
 
 224
 00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,031
 Though a bald head
 is a bit of a shocker.
 
 225
 00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,673
 I know it was for me.
 
 226
 00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,316
 Oh, you have a good-shaped head.
 
 227
 00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,839
 -May I?
 -Oh, sure.
 
 228
 00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,112
 -For good luck, right?
 -Exactly. Here's hoping.
 
 229
 00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,878
 -We could use some of that.
 -Yeah.
 
 230
 00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,153
 Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
 for what you've done for my dad.
 
 231
 00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,916
 -It was a really good thing.
 -You're very welcome.
 
 232
 00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,112
 -We're gonna find a way to repay you.
 -No, no, no.
 
 233
 00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,312
 We don't wanna ever hear that.
 
 234
 00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,473
 You know, I hate to say it...
 
 235
 00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,672
 ...but I really need to get going.
 
 236
 00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,438
 Oh, that's too bad.
 
 237
 00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,596
 -You can't stay for dinner?
 -I wish I could...
 
 238
 00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,997
 ...but unfortunately,
 I have to try to beat the traffic.
 
 239
 00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,155
 Okay. Okay.
 
 240
 00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,956
 Well, I hope we get a chance
 to catch up real soon.
 
 241
 00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,388
 Yeah, hopefully.
 
 242
 00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,319
 Gretchen, your purse.
 
 243
 00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,228
 Well, good to see you.
 
 244
 00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,993
 And you and Elliott
 are welcome anytime. Really.
 
 245
 00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,310
 And I, for one, am gonna be
 much better about keeping in touch.
 
 246
 00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,556
 -It's so good to see you.
 -And you.
 
 247
 00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,514
 -Nice meeting you.
 -Likewise.
 
 248
 00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,429
 -Okay. Bye, now.
 -Drive safely.
 
 249
 00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,872
 You know, what am I thinking?
 I should walk her to her car. Really.
 
 250
 00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,832
 I'll be right back.
 
 251
 00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,118
 Gretchen.
 
 252
 00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,035
 Hey.
 
 253
 00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,268
 -Hey.
 -Hey yourself.
 
 254
 00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,232
 What did you...?
 
 255
 00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,432
 We need to talk.
 
 256
 00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,519
 Can you not do or say
 anything to anyone until then?
 
 257
 00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,598
 Please. Please.
 
 258
 00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,677
 Where's my money, bitch?
 I ain't gonna keep asking nice!
 
 259
 00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,839
 Yo, all right? I want my money
 and my dope. Come on!
 
 260
 00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,237
 -I just wanna say, man--
 -What? What do you wanna say?
 
 261
 00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,873
 I just wanna go on record, man.
 
 262
 00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,311
 You hit me really, really hard, man.
 I think I'm seeing double.
 
 263
 00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,715
 -Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
 -Shut up!
 
 264
 00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,638
 Jesus.
 
 265
 00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,037
 -Serious, I might have a concussion.
 -Don't fall asleep, baby.
 
 266
 00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,071
 -Subdural hematoma.
 -Don't fall asleep.
 
 267
 00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,714
 Shut up.
 
 268
 00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,953
 All right. Empty your pockets.
 
 269
 00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,435
 Turn them out,
 everything on the table.
 
 270
 00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,789
 Do it!
 
 271
 00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,039
 All right, turn around.
 
 272
 00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,434
 Turn around.
 
 273
 00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,115
 Turn out your back pockets.
 Come on.
 
 274
 00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,509
 All right. Shoes. Give them here.
 
 275
 00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,351
 I told you, Diesel,
 we ain't holding anyâ€”276
 00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,152
 -We shot it all.
 -Yeah?
 
 277
 00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,513
 -Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
 -Yeah.
 
 278
 00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,756
 All right, tell you what.
 
 279
 00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,589
 Both of you
 pull it out of your butts right now...
 
 280
 00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,588
 ...or I grab a flashlight and
 some pliers and go exploring.
 
 281
 00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,631
 What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.
 
 282
 00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,638
 There you go.
 
 283
 00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,630
 All right, come on.
 On the table.
 
 284
 00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,671
 All right, so, what, you hold the
 crystal and she holds the H, huh?
 
 285
 00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,869
 Division of labour.
 
 286
 00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,029
 All right,
 there's maybe an 8 ball here.
 
 287
 00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,231
 Where's the rest of my meth?
 
 288
 00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,749
 Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.
 
 289
 00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,757
 -You shut up.
 -You shut up, skank.
 
 290
 00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,679
 Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!
 
 291
 00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,391
 This really isn't getting any better,
 man. It's turning cranial.
 
 292
 00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,956
 Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
 It's got five bullets.
 
 293
 00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,197
 One for each kneecap,
 plus an extra round for your cranial...
 
 294
 00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,073
 ...for being such a pussy.
 
 295
 00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,790
 Hey. Hey, baby.
 
 296
 00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,709
 Come here, baby.
 Come here, baby.
 
 297
 00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,392
 All right.
 
 298
 00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,876
 You two are never
 getting high again.
 
 299
 00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,548
 I will make it my life's mission.
 
 300
 00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,320
 Not another needle,
 not another ball...
 
 301
 00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,399
 ...not one toke,
 not till I get what's mine.
 
 302
 00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,477
 Yeah, we got you covered,
 man, sure.
 
 303
 00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,717
 It just so happens we got
 your money, man, plus interest.
 
 304
 00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,353
 You're damn right, plus interest.
 
 305
 00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,949
 -Where?
 -Back yard.
 
 306
 00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,674
 Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
 Back yard. Go check it out.
 
 307
 00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,917
 -Hurting. Painful.
 -Hey, hey, hey.
 
 308
 00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,669
 Me and your old man,
 we're just playing a game, all right?
 
 309
 00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,758
 Hey, don't move.
 
 310
 00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,592
 Come on.
 
 311
 00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,114
 See?
 
 312
 00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,437
 Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
 She's like a ant, man.
 
 313
 00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,359
 She can lift a hundred times
 her own weight. For real.
 
 314
 00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,278
 What am I supposed to do with this?
 
 315
 00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,313
 Help me break it open.
 Take out the money, get paid.
 
 316
 00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,715
 Get high.
 
 317
 00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,353
 Yo, that's my bank.
 
 318
 00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,676
 So? It's FIDC insured, yo.
 
 319
 00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,269
 It's a victimless crime.
 
 320
 00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,949
 ''Where did you get this?''
 
 321
 00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,355
 ''Bodega. Way across town.''
 
 322
 00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,949
 ''In, out, like, bam.''
 ''Went smooth as silk, yo.''
 
 323
 00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,318
 ''What, nobody saw you?''
 ''What about witnesses, dumbass?''
 
 324
 00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,590
 ''We roll like the breeze, for real.''
 
 325
 00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,030
 ''All we did,''
 ''we just walked in all smooth-like.''
 
 326
 00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,390
 ''-Nobody even noticed.''
 ''-Nobody noticed?''
 
 327
 00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,071
 ''-For real?''
 ''-I'm telling you, victimless crime.''
 
 328
 00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,797
 Oh, my God.
 
 329
 00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,709
 Jesus. Come on already.
 
 330
 00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,230
 -It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
 -You don't know what you're doing.
 
 331
 00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,749
 I thought you told me
 you boosted, like, six of these.
 
 332
 00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,030
 Yeah. Boosted.
 
 333
 00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,117
 It's not like he ever got one open.
 
 334
 00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,038
 At least I got persistence.
 
 335
 00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,993
 The law of averages,
 lucky number seven.
 
 336
 00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,557
 -Don't listen to that skank.
 -Stop calling me that.
 
 337
 00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,759
 I ain't no skank!
 
 338
 00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,190
 -Skank, skank, skank--
 -Hey, hey, hey.
 
 339
 00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,833
 Sit, sit.
 
 340
 00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,953
 All right, I swear to God
 I will shoot you both in the face.
 
 341
 00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,637
 Now, chill.
 
 342
 00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,998
 You, get that thing open.
 
 343
 00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,193
 You sit the hell down,
 and no throwing things.
 
 344
 00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,391
 Where's the kid?
 
 345
 00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,319
 The kid. The little kid!
 
 346
 00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,353
 What are you asking me for?
 
 347
 00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,396
 I got you now, bitch. I got you now.
 
 348
 00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,794
 Didn't see that coming, huh?
 
 349
 00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,548
 What kind of mother are you?
 
 350
 00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,276
 How about you feed the kid a decent
 meal every now and then, huh?
 
 351
 00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,914
 Give him a bath.
 Put some baby powder on him.
 
 352
 00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,680
 Get him some decent TV to watch.
 I mean, what is this shit?
 
 353
 00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,279
 Are you serious?
 
 354
 00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,472
 You give me one hit, and I'll be
 any kind of mother that you want.
 
 355
 00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,999
 -Oh, my God.
 -Yeah, Diesel...
 
 356
 00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,953
 ...this thing would go easier
 if we all had a little taste, man.
 
 357
 00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,393
 Get out of the way.
 
 358
 00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,110
 Get out of the way!
 
 359
 00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,639
 So you didn't tell anyone.
 
 360
 00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,071
 -You didn't tell Elliott.
 -Not yet.
 
 361
 00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,355
 -Well, what does that mean?
 -That means exactly what it means.
 
 362
 00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,711
 That's a determination
 I have yet to make.
 
 363
 00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,477
 All right, fair enough.
 I can appreciate that.
 
 364
 00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,749
 All right.
 
 365
 00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,034
 First let me say, I very much
 regret involving you in this.
 
 366
 00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,117
 This was....
 
 367
 00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,995
 This entire thing was unfortunate.
 
 368
 00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,350
 Unfortunate?
 
 369
 00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,717
 And I apologise deeply.
 
 370
 00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,759
 Thank you.
 
 371
 00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,391
 Now please tell me why you did it.
 
 372
 00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,755
 That's not really at issue here.
 
 373
 00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,834
 Well, you told me your insurance
 was covering it. Was that a lie?
 
 374
 00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,957
 If you won't take our money,
 and your insurance isn't covering it...
 
 375
 00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,559
 ...how are you paying for it?
 
 376
 00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,311
 This is not an issue
 that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?
 
 377
 00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,559
 Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
 It concerns me greatly.
 
 378
 00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,354
 You tell your wife and son...
 
 379
 00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,676
 ...that I am paying
 for your cancer treatment.
 
 380
 00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,394
 Why are you doing this?
 
 381
 00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,873
 I will clear this up with them.
 
 382
 00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,152
 The look on Skyler's face,
 she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...
 
 383
 00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,918
 ...thanking me for saving your life.
 
 384
 00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,033
 -Why would you do that to her?
 -As I said, I will clear this up.
 
 385
 00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,756
 Just please allow me to do this
 in my own way, in my own time.
 
 386
 00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,915
 All right?
 
 387
 00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,634
 I will explain
 the whole thing to them.
 
 388
 00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,195
 And while you're at it,
 explain it to me.
 
 389
 00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,230
 I don't owe you an explanation.
 
 390
 00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,910
 I owe you an apology,
 and I have apologised.
 
 391
 00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,793
 I am very sorry, Gretchen.
 
 392
 00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,833
 There. I've apologised twice now.
 
 393
 00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,793
 I'm humbly sorry.
 
 394
 00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,399
 Three times.
 
 395
 00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,477
 Let me just get this straight.
 
 396
 00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,955
 Elliott and I offer
 to pay for your treatment...
 
 397
 00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,559
 ...no strings attached.
 
 398
 00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,876
 An offer which still stands,
 by the way.
 
 399
 00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
 And you turn us down out of pride,
 whatever...
 
 400
 00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,072
 ...and then you tell your wife that in
 fact we are paying for your treatment.
 
 401
 00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,032
 Without our knowledge,
 against our will...
 
 402
 00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,151
 ...you involve us in your lie.
 
 403
 00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,992
 And you sit here and tell me
 that that is none of my business?
 
 404
 00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,708
 Yeah.
 That's pretty much the size of it.
 
 405
 00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,395
 What happened to you?
 
 406
 00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,196
 Really, Walt.
 
 407
 00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,118
 What happened?
 
 408
 00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,993
 Because this isn't you.
 
 409
 00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,629
 What would you know about me,
 Gretchen?
 
 410
 00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,072
 What would your presumption
 about me be, exactly?
 
 411
 00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,510
 That I should go begging
 for your charity?
 
 412
 00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,397
 And you waving
 your chequebook around...
 
 413
 00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,990
 ...like some magic wand
 is gonna make me forget...
 
 414
 00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,269
 ...how you and Elliottâ€”415
 00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,438
 How you and Elliott cut me out?
 
 416
 00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,358
 What? That can't be how you see it.
 
 417
 00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,870
 It was my hard work, my research,
 and you and Elliott make millions off it.
 
 418
 00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,911
 That cannot be how you see it.
 
 419
 00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,951
 -Good. That's beautifully done.
 -You leftâ€”420
 00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,878
 You are always
 the picture of innocence.
 
 421
 00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,514
 -You left me.
 -The picture of innocence.
 
 422
 00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,110
 -Just sweetness and light.
 -You left me.
 
 423
 00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,108
 Newport, 4 July weekend.
 
 424
 00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,312
 You and my father and my brothers
 and I go up to our room...
 
 425
 00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,988
 ...and you're packing your bags,
 barely talking.
 
 426
 00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,760
 What? Did I dream all of that?
 
 427
 00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,349
 That's your excuse...
 
 428
 00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,233
 ...to build your little empire
 on my work?
 
 429
 00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,590
 How can you say that to me?
 You walked away.
 
 430
 00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,712
 You abandoned us, me, Elliott.
 
 431
 00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,514
 Little rich girl
 just adding to your millions.
 
 432
 00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,196
 I don't even know what to say to you.
 
 433
 00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,792
 I don't even know where to begin.
 
 434
 00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,000
 I feel so sorry for you, Walt.
 
 435
 00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,914
 Fuck you.
 
 436
 00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,911
 Hey.
 
 437
 00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,230
 Hey, little man, you hungry?
 
 438
 00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,959
 Hey.
 
 439
 00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,593
 Man. No, no, what are you doing?
 
 440
 00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,349
 No, what are you doing?
 
 441
 00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,591
 Spooge, I got him, I got him.
 
 442
 00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,392
 Baby, get up and help me.
 
 443
 00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,990
 Call me a bad mother.
 I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.
 
 444
 00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,031
 Get up, damn it! Get our dope!
 
 445
 00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,795
 Bedtime.
 
 446
 00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,834
 Here we go. Oh, yeah.
 
 447
 00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,159
 Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
 Is that you?
 
 448
 00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,157
 Is that you? You're the big man?
 
 449
 00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,920
 Try and hit me now, bitch.
 Try and hit me now!
 
 450
 00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,634
 Try and hit me now, bitch.
 
 451
 00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,308
 Oh, hey.
 
 452
 00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,829
 Should I ask where you've been?
 
 453
 00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,558
 Never mind.
 
 454
 00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,638
 We're long past that, I suppose.
 
 455
 00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,432
 Skyler.
 
 456
 00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,596
 Gretchen called about an hour ago.
 
 457
 00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,192
 Walt.
 
 458
 00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,235
 We need to talk.
 
 459
 00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,317
 Just say it.
 
 460
 00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,473
 They're cutting off the money.
 
 461
 00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,593
 What did she say, exactly?
 
 462
 00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,635
 Not much. It was abrupt.
 
 463
 00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,515
 She said something like:
 
 464
 00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,714
 "I'm sorry to have to do this...
 
 465
 00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,311
 ...but Elliott and I can no longer
 continue to pay for Walt's treatment.
 
 466
 00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,478
 I wish you the very best."
 
 467
 00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,355
 And that was it.
 
 468
 00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,313
 Yeah.
 
 469
 00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,033
 I mean, she sounded apologetic.
 I guess.
 
 470
 00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,071
 It was quick.
 She got right off the phone.
 
 471
 00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,669
 I was so stunned, but....
 
 472
 00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,590
 I called her back
 and she didn't pick up.
 
 473
 00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,348
 So, what do you know about this?
 
 474
 00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,789
 I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
 visit this afternoon...
 
 475
 00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,470
 ...and then you come home
 and she's in a big hurry to leave...
 
 476
 00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,831
 ...and then the two of you
 are talking in the driveway.
 
 477
 00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,392
 Walt.
 
 478
 00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,996
 What do you know that I don't?
 
 479
 00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,035
 Where were you tonight?
 
 480
 00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,353
 I drove up to Santa Fe.
 
 481
 00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,114
 I was with Gretchen.
 
 482
 00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,437
 Well, Gretchen and Elliott.
 
 483
 00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,951
 She just couldn't bring
 herself to tell you today.
 
 484
 00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,913
 I mean, she couldn't tell me,
 either, really.
 
 485
 00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,112
 I mean, there was
 a lot of hemming and hawing...
 
 486
 00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,117
 ...and beating around the bushâ€”487
 00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,029
 Okay, what--? Tell us what?
 
 488
 00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,392
 Well....
 
 489
 00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,269
 There was a lot of...
 
 490
 00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,795
 ...business phraseology
 being tossed around.
 
 491
 00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,313
 You know, things like "cash-poor"
 and "leveraged"...
 
 492
 00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,397
 ..."quarterly decline,"
 yadda, yadda, yadda.
 
 493
 00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,752
 But what they were truly saying,
 in my opinion....
 
 494
 00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,999
 They're broke.
 
 495
 00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,433
 -You are kidding me.
 -No.
 
 496
 00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,873
 I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
 We all know that.
 
 497
 00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,517
 And all these big banks
 and Fannie Mae and....
 
 498
 00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,280
 Well, apparently, Gray Matter...
 
 499
 00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,155
 ...is no more immune
 than anyone else.
 
 500
 00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,072
 That isâ€”501
 00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,796
 Jesus, that's....
 
 502
 00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,348
 Yeah.
 
 503
 00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,030
 You know, she could have
 just told me herself.
 
 504
 00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,988
 Well, they're prideful people.
 
 505
 00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,078
 Listen.
 
 506
 00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,636
 Not to sound selfish...
 
 507
 00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,715
 ...but as far as we go...
 
 508
 00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,230
 ...we'll get through this, okay?
 
 509
 00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,915
 I mean, they've already paid
 for most of my treatment, right?
 
 510
 00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,549
 Hey.
 
 511
 00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,991
 We're gonna make it. All right?
 I promise.
 
 512
 00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,077
 Okay.
 
 513
 00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,151
 And yet...
 
 514
 00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,318
 ...she still drives a Bentley.
 
 515
 00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,239
 Keeping up appearances.
 Who knows?
 
 516
 00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,953
 Baby, that don't make any sense.
 
 517
 00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,709
 Of course it makes sense.
 Every safe's got its weak spot, right?
 
 518
 00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,593
 You're designing a safe, where
 you gonna put your weak spot?
 
 519
 00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,199
 Nowhere.
 
 520
 00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,198
 I'd make it, like, strong.
 
 521
 00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,391
 Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.
 
 522
 00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,636
 You put your weak spot
 on the bottom.
 
 523
 00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,356
 Oh, baby,
 that H is bringing me down.
 
 524
 00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,755
 Yeah, you took too much. I told you.
 
 525
 00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,838
 I need to.... I need to even out.
 
 526
 00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,112
 -Let me get a hit of that crystal.
 -Hell, no. You lost your share.
 
 527
 00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,548
 Come on, baby.
 
 528
 00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,638
 It's all I need, just a little hit.
 
 529
 00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,594
 Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
 I'm trying to concentrate.
 
 530
 00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,552
 I ain't no skank.
 
 531
 00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,955
 I would appreciate an apology.
 
 532
 00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,509
 What?
 
 533
 00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,314
 I am trying to take
 the high road here.
 
 534
 00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,794
 Are you gonna do right?
 
 535
 00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,035
 Listen to me, stupid.
 
 536
 00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,596
 I am in the middle
 of some very important work.
 
 537
 00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,395
 I am on the verge here, all right?
 So shut your skank ass pie hole...
 
 538
 00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,956
 ...and assist me and shut up.
 
 539
 00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,356
 I ain't no skank.
 
 540
 00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,437
 Skank, skank, skank ass skank.
 
 541
 00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,958
 Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.
 
 542
 00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,874
 You listening to me, skank?
 
 543
 00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,668
 You hear me, skank?
 
 544
 00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,793
 You are a skank ass skank. Skank.
 
 545
 00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,709
 Skank, skank, skank. Skank.
 
 546
 00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,957
 I ain't no skank.
 
 547
 00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,629
 No, no, no. Don't. No.
 
 548
 00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,959
 I ain't no skank.
 
 549
 00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,509
 ''911.''
 
 550
 00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,634
 Hey, hey.
 Hey, you remember peekaboo?
 
 551
 00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,912
 Can you go peekaboo like this?
 Can you keep your eyes closed?
 
 552
 00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,714
 You keep them closed. That's good.
 That's good. That's good.
 
 553
 00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,036
 All right.
 You keep them closed just like that.
 
 554
 00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,550
 It's a little game
 we're gonna play, okay?
 
 555
 00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,311
 Here you go.
 
 556
 00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,957
 Hey. Hey, look at me.
 You wait right here. Okay?
 
 557
 00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,630
 It's just part of the game.
 You wait right here, and....
 
 558
 00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,429
 Look, just....
 Just don't go back inside. All right?
 
 559
 00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,438
 You stay right here. Okay?
 
 560
 00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,510
 You have a good
 rest of your life, kid.
