 1
 00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,264
 In closing, I can tell you...
 
 2
 00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,768
 ...we take this very seriously.
 APD as well as the DEA.
 
 3
 00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:12,146
 Stopping the sale
 of methamphetamines...
 
 4
 00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,315
 ...remains one of
 our highest priorities.
 
 5
 00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,485
 The theft of lab equipment from your
 school is also receiving our attention.
 
 6
 00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,613
 Rest assured,
 no stone will go unturned...
 
 7
 00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,867
 ...in our search for the person
 or persons responsible for this.
 
 8
 00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,911
 If you have any questions,
 now would be the time. Sir.
 
 9
 00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,206
 You're talking like
 you haven't caught anybody yet.
 
 10
 00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:33,667
 What about the janitor
 dealing drugs at school?
 
 11
 00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,504
 There is no indication
 that this individual was selling drugs.
 
 12
 00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,466
 He was arrested for having
 a small amount of marijuana...
 
 13
 00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,010
 ...in his car, not in the school.
 
 14
 00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,970
 And he's since been fired.
 
 15
 00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:49,099
 He had a record. I'd like to know
 how he got a job here in the first place.
 
 16
 00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,976
 Why wasn't there
 a background check?
 
 17
 00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:55,522
 There was one. We're currently
 reviewing our hiring policies.
 
 18
 00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,193
 You better be doing more. This guy
 was arrested in front of my daughter.
 
 19
 00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,487
 This guy was stealing
 lab equipment, right?
 
 20
 00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:03,697
 That's not our thinking this time.
 
 21
 00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:07,159
 We're looking at others, but not
 limited to the maintenance staff.
 
 22
 00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:10,579
 Are you saying there was a break-in?
 Do we know when this happened?
 
 23
 00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:13,207
 I mean, could it have been
 during school hours?
 
 24
 00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,710
 We haven't been able to establish
 a date or time. There is no sign...
 
 25
 00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,212
 ...of breaking or entering.
 
 26
 00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,756
 So whoever took it had a key.
 
 27
 00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,218
 We're talking inside job?
 Someone who's still at the school?
 
 28
 00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,514
 Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss
 details with you. What I can tell you...
 
 29
 00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,225
 ...is we have good people
 working hard on this case.
 
 30
 00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,395
 I'm sorry, officer,
 but that just sounds like double talk.
 
 31
 00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,189
 We're trying to protect our children.
 Level with us.
 
 32
 00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:40,484
 Really, we're giving you
 all the information we have.
 
 33
 00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,529
 You know what I'd like to see
 in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.
 
 34
 00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,574
 Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and
 locker searches and strip-searches.
 
 35
 00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,578
 - Our district has strict policies...
 - I heard about this school in Canada...
 
 36
 00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,456
 ...they arrested one
 of the groundskeepers with drugs...
 
 37
 00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:58,252
 ...and the next day they found out over
 half the students were high on LSD.
 
 38
 00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,171
 LSD? When were you gonna tell us
 about the LSD?
 
 39
 00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:06,010
 No, please.
 No one said anything about LSD.
 
 40
 00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,348
 What about the equipment
 that's stolen?
 
 41
 00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:15,019
 The equipment was taken
 from our chemistry-department locker.
 
 44
 00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,483
 Walt?
 
 45
 00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,320
 Yeah.
 
 46
 00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,574
 Mr. White
 is currently on medical leave.
 
 47
 00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,951
 But as he's chair
 of the science department...
 
 48
 00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,330
 ...he's made a very special effort
 to be with us here.
 
 49
 00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,334
 And I'd like to take a moment
 to thank him for that.
 
 50
 00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,387
 Could you please tell us more
 about the equipment that was taken?
 
 51
 00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,931
 - Please.
 - Yes.
 
 52
 00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,725
 Sorry.
 
 53
 00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,145
 And thank you.
 
 54
 00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:05,235
 The inventory list
 for the missing lab-wear is as follows:
 
 55
 00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:10,616
 ''One 5000 millilitre''
 ''round-bottom boiling flask. ''
 
 56
 00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:15,412
 ''One Kildall-style recovery flask,''
 ''800 millilitres. ''
 
 57
 00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,457
 ''Two full-face respirators. ''
 
 58
 00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:22,461
 ''Some CEP funnels, some head''
 ''with a thermometer holder. ''
 
 59
 00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,013
 - Okay.
 - Okay. Okay.
 
 60
 00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:41,522
 Where did that come from?
 And why was it so damn good?
 
 61
 00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,317
 Because it was illegal.
 
 62
 00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,234
 The basement.
 Unfinished, of course.
 
 63
 00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,323
 But just look at all this space.
 You gotta think rec room, media room.
 
 64
 00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,576
 Just imagine all the things
 you could do down here.
 
 65
 00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:39,455
 Now remember, you're buying
 for this fantastic neighbourhood.
 
 66
 00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:44,084
 Big lawns and shade trees,
 walking distance to the country club.
 
 67
 00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,052
 What happened there?
 
 68
 00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:58,349
 Bit of a fixer,
 but this house has great bones.
 
 69
 00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,440
 Know what? We're zeroing in. I've got
 another listing, new, around the corner.
 
 70
 00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:07,900
 - Yeah?
 - Yeah.
 
 71
 00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,527
 - Hi.
 - Hi.
 
 72
 00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,991
 - It's by appointment only.
 - Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.
 
 73
 00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:21,622
 He's in the recreational vehicle.
 
 74
 00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:30,089
 Yo, it's appointment only.
 
 75
 00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,978
 How are you feeling?
 
 76
 00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:53,278
 About as good as you look.
 Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.
 
 77
 00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,448
 Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
 but you were asleep.
 
 78
 00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,868
 Yeah, Skinny Pete
 said you wanted Tuco's address.
 
 79
 00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,705
 Acting like you're all out for blood.
 
 80
 00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,458
 But you are alive.
 Obviously you wised up.
 
 81
 00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,378
 - No, I did go see him.
 - Bullshit.
 
 82
 00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:12,548
 - So, what, are you selling your house?
 - I got two dudes...
 
 83
 00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,843
 ...that turned into raspberry slushy
 and flushed down my toilet.
 
 84
 00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,429
 I can't even
 take a proper dump in there.
 
 85
 00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,016
 I mean, the whole damn house
 has gotta be haunted by now.
 
 86
 00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,519
 You didn't actually go see Tuco.
 
 87
 00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,147
 Here.
 
 88
 00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,321
 That is 17,500.
 Your half of the 35,000.
 
 89
 00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:39,908
 Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
 It's all yours. You've earned it.
 
 90
 00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,661
 - You got this money from Tuco?
 - Yeah.
 
 91
 00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:45,748
 So Tuco gave you this,
 is what you're saying.
 
 92
 00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:46,957
 Well, we made a deal.
 
 93
 00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,585
 - You made a deal?
 - That's right.
 
 94
 00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,922
 How...? Why would you
 make a deal with that scumbag?
 
 95
 00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,383
 - You see what he did to me?
 - Because I think...
 
 96
 00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,220
 ...that we can do business together.
 We came to an understanding.
 
 97
 00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,681
 No way, man.
 Okay? No understanding.
 
 98
 00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,892
 Take a look
 at the money in your hand.
 
 99
 00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,646
 Now, just imagine
 making that every week.
 
 100
 00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:13,484
 That's right.
 Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.
 
 101
 00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:19,823
 Without even talking to me
 you told this insane ass-clown...
 
 102
 00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,369
 ...dead-eyed killer that...
 
 103
 00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,412
 That we would
 give him 2 pounds a week.
 
 104
 00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,290
 We'll just scale up our operation,
 add a few more hours.
 
 105
 00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,084
 No, don't talk to me about hours.
 
 106
 00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,545
 What about pseudo, man?
 How are we gonna get that?
 
 107
 00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:37,508
 You think the meth fairy's
 just gonna bring it to us?
 
 108
 00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,094
 God, it takes me a week
 to get this stuff.
 
 109
 00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,346
 I'm driving
 all the way to Las Cruces...
 
 110
 00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,557
 ...200 miles each way
 to meet up with my smurfs.
 
 111
 00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,727
 - Smurfs?
 - The dudes who go to the drugstores...
 
 112
 00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:51,814
 ...and get a couple boxes at a time
 and then sell them to me.
 
 113
 00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,900
 That's maybe only good for,
 like, maybe a half-pound worth.
 
 114
 00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:59,154
 See, that's the bottleneck
 in your brilliant business plan.
 
 115
 00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,364
 All right.
 
 116
 00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,951
 Of course, you would've know
 that if you would've just asked me.
 
 117
 00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,540
 - Well, here we are again.
 - Here we are.
 
 118
 00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,375
 - Skyler, you look great.
 - Thank you.
 
 119
 00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,919
 You must be, what, 6, 7 months?
 
 120
 00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,339
 - How goes it?
 - It's great.
 
 121
 00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,218
 Other than waddling
 to the bathroom every five minutes.
 
 122
 00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:23,595
 The baby shower is next week.
 
 123
 00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,848
 And it'll be good to...
 
 124
 00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,601
 It'll be good to have a day
 that's just about Skyler.
 
 125
 00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,729
 Very nice.
 
 126
 00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,189
 - Thank you.
 - Thank you.
 
 127
 00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:38,193
 - Walt, I see you committed to hair loss.
 - Yeah.
 
 128
 00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,696
 - How do you feel?
 - Okay.
 
 129
 00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:44,241
 L... You know, pretty decent, actually.
 
 130
 00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,703
 His colour is better.
 You know, his energy.
 
 131
 00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:52,416
 And he's even more physical.
 
 132
 00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,126
 More physical?
 
 133
 00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,421
 Well, sexual.
 
 134
 00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,636
 Frisky, actually. I mean,
 that's gotta be a good sign, right?
 
 135
 00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,972
 - Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
 - Right.
 
 136
 00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,642
 Couldn't that mean
 that the chemo is working?
 
 137
 00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:13,854
 Well, realistically, it may just mean that
 we've got the antiemetics tuned right.
 
 138
 00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:16,982
 Truth is, until Walt's finished
 this round of chemo...
 
 139
 00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,444
 ...and we look at a new PET scan,
 we just can't say for sure.
 
 140
 00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,197
 Well, isn't there anything else
 we could be doing?
 
 141
 00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,492
 I've been wondering
 about alternative medicine.
 
 142
 00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,079
 I mean, Eastern healing.
 
 143
 00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:34,458
 - You know, holistic.
 - Well, I can't speak to its efficacy...
 
 144
 00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,503
 ...but as long as it doesn't
 interfere with our treatment...
 
 145
 00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,631
 ...anything that helps my patient
 have a better outlook...
 
 146
 00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:44,551
 ...a better comfort, is fine by me.
 
 147
 00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:49,014
 So you're saying
 it's just all psychological.
 
 148
 00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,433
 It doesn't make any real difference.
 
 149
 00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:55,229
 Having a better outlook
 can make a tremendous difference.
 
 150
 00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:59,525
 But it's also important
 that we manage our expectations.
 
 151
 00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,463
 What?
 
 152
 00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,556
 A junkyard?
 Let me guess, you picked this place?
 
 153
 00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,518
 What's wrong with it? It's private.
 
 154
 00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:39,064
 This is like a non-criminal's
 idea of a drug meet.
 
 155
 00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,984
 This is, "Oh, I saw this in a movie.
 Look at me. "
 
 156
 00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:45,946
 Yes. So where do you transact
 your business? Enlighten me.
 
 157
 00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,907
 I don't know,
 how about Taco Cabeza?
 
 158
 00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:52,036
 Half the deals I've ever done
 went down at Taco Cabeza.
 
 159
 00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:56,623
 Nice and public. Open 24 hours.
 
 160
 00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,252
 Nobody ever gets shot
 at Taco Cabeza.
 
 161
 00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,464
 Hell, why not the mall?
 
 162
 00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:07,051
 You know, wait at the Gap.
 Hey, it's time for the meet.
 
 163
 00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:10,012
 You know, I'll put down
 the flat-front khakis...
 
 164
 00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,473
 ...head on over,
 grab an Orange Julius.
 
 165
 00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,268
 Skip the part where
 psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know...
 
 166
 00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:20,189
 ...comes and steals my drugs
 and leaves me bleeding to death.
 
 167
 00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:32,159
 Look, you don't
 have to be here for this.
 
 168
 00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,244
 Okay? I mean, seriously.
 
 169
 00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,205
 I'm okay.
 
 170
 00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,418
 No. I'm no pussy.
 
 171
 00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,963
 I'm good.
 
 172
 00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,898
 Mr. Clean and his boy.
 
 173
 00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,027
 Now, I'm sorry
 that I had to tune you up.
 
 174
 00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,447
 Respect, ''ése,''
 you gotta give it to get it.
 
 175
 00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:16,620
 Hey, what are we doing
 way the hell out here?
 
 176
 00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,540
 What, they close the mall
 or something?
 
 177
 00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,627
 Heisenberg, come on, break it out.
 
 178
 00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:31,719
 - That's it? That's all you got?
 - We had some production problems.
 
 179
 00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,054
 0.53.
 
 180
 00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,515
 I thought you was a player.
 
 181
 00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,643
 You told me 2 pounds...
 
 182
 00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,272
 ...and now you waste my time
 with these Chiclets?
 
 183
 00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:58,620
 Seventeen and a half.
 Minus the half for wasting my time.
 
 184
 00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,248
 - Hey, come on.
 - What, you gonna argue?
 
 185
 00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,876
 You got something to say?
 
 186
 00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,715
 You're doing business
 like a couple little bitches.
 
 187
 00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,134
 I want all of it.
 
 188
 00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,972
 Seventy grand.
 
 189
 00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,600
 - What did you say?
 - You like this product.
 
 190
 00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,685
 And you want more.
 
 191
 00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,813
 Consider it a capital investment.
 
 192
 00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,069
 Look, old, bald motherfucker.
 
 193
 00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,450
 Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig.
 
 194
 00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,036
 Vig?
 
 195
 00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,289
 Interest, weekly.
 
 196
 00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,001
 Okay.
 
 197
 00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,967
 That's $65,625 with interest.
 
 198
 00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:57,346
 - 1.875 pounds.
 - No, 2 pounds.
 
 199
 00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:00,933
 Next Friday,
 and no production problems.
 
 200
 00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,603
 Can you handle 4 pounds?
 
 201
 00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:12,152
 Listen, old man, talk is talk.
 
 202
 00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:17,324
 But owing me money, that's bad.
 
 203
 00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:42,725
 What did you just do?
 
 204
 00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,859
 4 pounds. 4 pounds.
 2 pounds wasn't bad enough.
 
 205
 00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:56,113
 We're talking 2-, 300 boxes
 of sinus pills.
 
 206
 00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,282
 There ain't that many smurfs
 in the world.
 
 207
 00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,451
 We're not gonna need
 pseudoephedrine.
 
 208
 00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,495
 We're gonna make phenylacetone
 in a tube furnace.
 
 209
 00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:07,958
 We're gonna use reductive amination
 to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.
 
 210
 00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,878
 - So no pseudo?
 - No pseudo.
 
 211
 00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,838
 So you do have a plan.
 
 212
 00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,299
 Yeah, Mr. White.
 
 213
 00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,884
 Yeah, science.
 
 214
 00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,553
 Okay.
 
 215
 00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:26,101
 - What's this?
 - That is a shopping list.
 
 216
 00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:29,772
 Getting some of those items
 may be challenging.
 
 217
 00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,274
 One autotransformer...
 
 218
 00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:38,030
 ...6 litres anhydrous methenamine.
 
 219
 00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:42,451
 - Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
 - It's mm, millimetre.
 
 220
 00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:45,788
 One 70 millimetre would be fine,
 but they're hard to come by.
 
 221
 00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:48,248
 40 grams thorium nitrate.
 
 222
 00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:51,168
 Yo, Mr. White,
 I can't even pronounce half this shit.
 
 223
 00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,045
 No. Count me out. All right?
 
 224
 00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:55,714
 I'm leaving town.
 I'm moving to Oregon or something.
 
 225
 00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,550
 - This is just...
 - Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.
 
 226
 00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:04,014
 Today is the first day
 of the rest of your life.
 
 227
 00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,101
 - What are you doing?
 - The first day of the rest of your life.
 
 228
 00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,894
 But what kind of life will it be?
 
 229
 00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:12,940
 Will it be a life of fear,
 of "Oh, no, no, no. I can't do this. "
 
 230
 00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,026
 Of never once believing in yourself?
 
 231
 00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,655
 - I don't know.
 - Listen.
 
 232
 00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,866
 These things?
 We need them, all right?
 
 233
 00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,744
 And only you can get them for us.
 
 234
 00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:35,713
 ''Okay, it's ready. Here you go. ''
 
 235
 00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,592
 ''Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.''
 
 236
 00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,762
 ''Of course you already know that''
 ''because when you watch this... ''
 
 237
 00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,182
 ''...20 years from now, I will look''
 ''exactly the same as I do now. ''
 
 238
 00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:52,938
 ''I know, it is amazing. ''
 ''I have aged shockingly well. Haven't I?''
 
 239
 00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:58,527
 ''Anyway, weIcome to your baby shower,''
 ''Esmeralda. ''
 
 240
 00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,488
 ''- Esmeralda?''
 ''- Esmeralda. ''
 
 241
 00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,907
 ''That's your name''
 ''and you heard it here first. ''
 
 242
 00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:08,537
 ''Now, that is your wonderful,''
 ''handsome older brother. ''
 
 243
 00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:11,498
 ''Show her, older brother, your face.''
 
 244
 00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,920
 ''Okay, not right up the nose. Don't... ''
 ''Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.''
 
 245
 00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:21,925
 ''Here's your mommy. Hello, Mom. ''
 
 246
 00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:25,429
 ''- And look, there you are, Esmeralda. ''
 ''- Yeah. ''
 
 247
 00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:32,144
 ''- Wake up, baby. Time to party. ''
 ''- Easy, easy. Believe it or not... ''
 
 248
 00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:37,441
 ''...Esmeralda, right after the party,''
 ''your name was changed to Holly. ''
 
 249
 00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,902
 ''And I believe, Hank,''
 ''that was around the time...''
 
 250
 00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,112
 ''...we took Aunt Marie''
 ''to the insane asylum. ''
 
 251
 00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,573
 ''Yeah, yeah, yeah. ''
 ''I dropped her off at the kerb. ''
 
 252
 00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,827
 ''Then I married Shania Twain''
 ''and lived happily ever after. ''
 
 253
 00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:56,877
 ''There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy. ''
 ''Say hello to your daughter. ''
 
 254
 00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:05,177
 ''Holly, I am very proud of you. ''
 
 255
 00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:09,765
 ''And I... ''
 ''I think about you all the time.''
 
 256
 00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:18,899
 ''Wherever you go,''
 ''whatever you do in life...''
 
 257
 00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:24,947
 ''...always know that you have a family''
 ''who loves you very, very much. ''
 
 258
 00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,244
 ''- Cheers. ''
 ''- Cheers. ''
 
 259
 00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:35,124
 Oh, my God, it's so cute.
 Oh, Carmen. It's...
 
 260
 00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,627
 Oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable.
 
 261
 00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:42,172
 - I love it, Carmen. Thank you.
 - You're so welcome, honey.
 
 262
 00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,592
 - Thank you.
 - Look at the little feet.
 
 263
 00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:53,183
 - Okay.
 - From me. And Hank.
 
 264
 00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,643
 What nice wrapping paper.
 
 265
 00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,979
 Marie always finds
 the best wrapping paper.
 
 266
 00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,023
 - I do.
 - Okay.
 
 267
 00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:03,152
 Let's see. And...
 
 268
 00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,611
 Exciting.
 
 269
 00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,325
 Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
 
 270
 00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:19,543
 - It's... It's a... A tiara.
 - Yes.
 
 271
 00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,922
 Marie, is this...?
 
 272
 00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,926
 White gold and several carats
 worth of zircons.
 
 273
 00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,596
 Oh, Marie.
 You spent too much on this.
 
 274
 00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,974
 You shouldn't have.
 You really, really shouldn't.
 
 275
 00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:38,145
 But it's so... It's really... It's...
 
 276
 00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,438
 It's sparkly.
 
 277
 00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,775
 - Sparkly.
 - I know.
 
 278
 00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,861
 - Thank you.
 - Hey, listen, Walt.
 
 279
 00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,821
 You got anything
 stronger than beer?
 
 280
 00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,824
 - It's... It's great. I love it.
 - Yeah.
 
 281
 00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:55,371
 Thank you.
 Thank you, sweetie, thank you.
 
 282
 00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,001
 Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after
 200 presents, it just gets kind of old.
 
 283
 00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,423
 - It's nice stuff.
 - It is, isn't it?
 
 284
 00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:12,972
 I got just the thing to go with that.
 
 285
 00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:21,480
 - I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking.
 - No, no, no. It's okay.
 
 286
 00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,565
 You mind if I have one?
 
 287
 00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:29,238
 - You think that's a good idea?
 - Hank, I've already got lung cancer.
 
 288
 00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:33,534
 Okay. You got me there.
 
 289
 00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,787
 Thanks.
 
 290
 00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,458
 Cuban.
 
 291
 00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:48,549
 I did a little favour for an FBI guy.
 
 292
 00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:54,430
 Now, I was under the impression...
 
 293
 00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:57,057
 ...that these were illegal.
 
 294
 00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:04,189
 Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit
 tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?
 
 295
 00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:12,323
 It's funny, isn't it?
 How we draw that line.
 
 296
 00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,116
 Yeah.
 
 297
 00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,493
 What line is that?
 
 298
 00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:24,251
 Well, what's legal, what's illegal.
 You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.
 
 299
 00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:30,174
 You know, if we were drinking this
 in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.
 
 300
 00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,594
 Another year, we'd be okay.
 
 301
 00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:37,598
 Who knows
 what will be legal next year.
 
 302
 00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,851
 You mean like pot?
 
 303
 00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:49,818
 Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.
 
 304
 00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:53,906
 Cocaine? Heroin?
 
 305
 00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,618
 I'm just saying it's arbitrary.
 
 306
 00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:03,415
 Well, you ought to visit lockup.
 You hear a lot of guys talking like that.
 
 307
 00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:07,252
 "Hey, man, what you busting me
 with these 14 bales of ganja?
 
 308
 00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,049
 It's all going to be legal next year
 when Willie Nelson's president. "
 
 309
 00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,634
 Say it, buddy.
 
 310
 00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,886
 It don't only go one way either.
 
 311
 00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:19,431
 I mean, some other stuff is legal
 that shouldn't be.
 
 312
 00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:23,894
 I mean,
 frigging meth used to be legal.
 
 313
 00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:28,440
 Used to sell it over every counter
 at every pharmacy across America.
 
 314
 00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:31,986
 Thank God they came to their senses
 on that one, huh?
 
 315
 00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,240
 Yeah.
 
 316
 00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,872
 Okay.
 
 317
 00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:51,380
 Nice party.
 
 318
 00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:56,802
 A tiara.
 
 319
 00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:01,640
 A white-gold tiara
 for a newborn baby.
 
 320
 00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:07,021
 Yeah. You know, I think she got that
 at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.
 
 321
 00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:13,527
 I mean, that thing must've cost,
 like, what, 5- or 600 dollars.
 
 322
 00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,615
 You know, I think I'm gonna return it.
 
 323
 00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:21,410
 Are you sure?
 She's bound to find out.
 
 324
 00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:25,664
 Well, maybe I can explain to her
 that we need a Diaper Genie...
 
 325
 00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:30,753
 ...more than a white-gold baby tiara.
 
 326
 00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:34,840
 Hey. You know, I've been thinking...
 
 327
 00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:38,344
 ...about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
 about alternative medicine.
 
 328
 00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,013
 No. Don't worry.
 I'm not gonna mention that anymore.
 
 329
 00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,601
 No, no, no. What I mean is that
 maybe there is something to it.
 
 330
 00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:53,400
 Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge
 up by Farmington.
 
 331
 00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,488
 Healing ceremony. It's supposed
 to be good for your lungs.
 
 332
 00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:00,032
 I'm not saying that I believe in it...
 
 333
 00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:05,704
 ...but it might be an experience.
 
 334
 00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,581
 Really.
 
 335
 00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,541
 You?
 
 336
 00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,001
 In a sweat lodge.
 
 337
 00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:15,297
 I was thinking about driving up
 on Friday, coming back Sunday.
 
 338
 00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:19,468
 - I mean, if you're okay with it.
 - Well, of course I'm okay with that.
 
 339
 00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,220
 Okay.
 
 340
 00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,231
 - Sweat lodge?
 - Yeah.
 
 341
 00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:34,900
 I'm already sweating. Help me out.
 
 342
 00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:37,861
 Okay.
 
 343
 00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,905
 Hey.
 
 344
 00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,076
 70 millimetre tube furnace. Excellent.
 
 345
 00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:46,495
 - This is excellent. Good work.
 - Damn straight.
 
 346
 00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:49,623
 Okay, hydrogen.
 Electrolytically produced, yes?
 
 347
 00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,709
 Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this...
 
 348
 00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,421
 This crap wasn't easy to get.
 And it's expensive.
 
 349
 00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,381
 Methylamine.
 Where's the methylamine?
 
 350
 00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:59,258
 I don't see the methylamine.
 
 351
 00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:03,387
 Yeah, well,
 that's where I ran into some trouble.
 
 352
 00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:04,972
 What kind a trouble?
 
 353
 00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,349
 Well, half this crap
 I could just buy, right?
 
 354
 00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,686
 But this methylamine...
 
 355
 00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,273
 Not so easy.
 I mean, they got it locked down tight.
 
 356
 00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,651
 But I did find some pros
 who will rip it off for us.
 
 357
 00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:20,696
 But they want 10 grand.
 
 358
 00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:22,698
 What's the problem?
 You have the money.
 
 359
 00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:25,451
 No, had.
 I spent almost the whole wad.
 
 360
 00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:29,872
 I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
 I told you, all this crap was expensive.
 
 361
 00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:34,043
 So these thieves, did they say
 where they would be stealing it from?
 
 362
 00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,962
 A chemical supply place,
 south of town.
 
 363
 00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:41,216
 They got guards and security cameras.
 They got steel doors.
 
 364
 00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:44,762
 That's why these dudes
 are charging so much.
 
 365
 00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,597
 What?
 
 366
 00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:04,239
 So why don't we
 just steal it ourselves.
 
 367
 00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:07,159
 Yeah?
 
 368
 00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:09,495
 How we gonna do that?
 
 369
 00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,539
 With this.
 
 370
 00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,181
 So, what's this stuff called again?
 
 371
 00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,103
 Thermite.
 
 372
 00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:36,522
 And that will cut through a lock?
 
 373
 00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:39,358
 Because this is supposed to be
 one big-ass lock.
 
 374
 00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,069
 In World War II...
 
 375
 00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:46,240
 ...the Germans had an artillery piece...
 It's the biggest in the world.
 
 376
 00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,367
 Called the Gustav Gun.
 
 377
 00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,161
 And it weighed a thousand tons.
 
 378
 00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:55,666
 And the Gustav
 was capable of firing a 7-ton shell...
 
 379
 00:26:55,833 --> 00:27:00,296
 ...and hitting a target,
 accurately, 23 miles away.
 
 380
 00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,634
 I mean, you could drop bombs on it
 every day for a month...
 
 381
 00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:08,262
 ...without ever disabling it.
 
 382
 00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,222
 But...
 
 383
 00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,349
 ...drop a commando...
 
 384
 00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:16,729
 ...one man, with just a bag of this...
 
 385
 00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,900
 ...and he could melt right through
 4 inches of solid steel...
 
 386
 00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,320
 ...and destroy that gun forever.
 
 387
 00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,283
 Jeez.
 
 388
 00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:34,079
 So yes...
 
 389
 00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:39,376
 ...I think it will cut through
 any lock we're likely to find.
 
 390
 00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:44,256
 - You'd like to return this.
 - It's very nice, but yes.
 
 391
 00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,634
 Well, it... It is from the store, isn't it?
 
 392
 00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,511
 Oh, yes, it's from this store.
 
 393
 00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:51,847
 Do you happen to have a receipt?
 
 394
 00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,516
 No, I don't. It was a gift.
 
 395
 00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,435
 A gift.
 
 396
 00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,854
 Mr. Wilson,
 could you step over here, please?
 
 397
 00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,943
 Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
 this lady while I phone the police.
 
 398
 00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,987
 Whoa, excuse me?
 
 399
 00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:10,699
 Ma'am, this item is stolen,
 as I'm sure you know.
 
 400
 00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:13,285
 - It...
 - Come with me, please.
 
 401
 00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:19,625
 Oh, yes. I intend to press charges.
 
 402
 00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,503
 Please do.
 
 403
 00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:25,005
 We'll be here.
 
 404
 00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:30,552
 Look, I...
 I've never stolen anything in my life.
 
 405
 00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:34,807
 All right?
 I told you, that tiara was a gift...
 
 406
 00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:38,185
 - A baby-shower gift.
 - So who gave it to you, then?
 
 407
 00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:43,941
 - I don't have to tell you that.
 - You don't have to tell me anything.
 
 408
 00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:45,943
 You can talk to the police.
 
 409
 00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,445
 I can tell them
 my daughter-in-law remembers...
 
 410
 00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,615
 ...showing this particular item
 to a tall blond woman...
 
 411
 00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:55,077
 ...who, when her back was turned,
 walked right out the door with it.
 
 412
 00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:56,996
 - So there.
 - Oh, yeah?
 
 413
 00:28:57,162 --> 00:29:01,166
 Well, then, I can talk
 to the Channel Three News.
 
 414
 00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,296
 Yeah, I can tell them
 how you people, without a shred...
 
 415
 00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:08,507
 Without a modicum of evidence,
 illegally detained...
 
 416
 00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:13,137
 ...an innocent pregnant woman
 in a dank storeroom.
 
 417
 00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:17,099
 - This is my office.
 - I feel I'm being held hostage.
 
 418
 00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:20,936
 Furthermore, I'm not
 getting enough air back here.
 
 419
 00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,731
 I don't think...
 I don't think I can breathe.
 
 420
 00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,775
 Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, no.
 
 421
 00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:30,070
 I'm going into labour. Yes, I...
 
 422
 00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:43,208
 ''Hi, you've reached Marie.''
 ''Do the beep thing. ''
 
 423
 00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,795
 Marie, it's Skyler.
 I just left Zachary's.
 
 424
 00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,883
 I need to talk to you immediately.
 
 425
 00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:55,387
 Where is the guard?
 He's supposed to be coming by.
 
 426
 00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,724
 - Do you think he already passed?
 - Look, I don't... I don't know.
 
 427
 00:29:58,891 --> 00:29:59,933
 Okay.
 
 428
 00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,478
 - Wait, there he is. There he is.
 - Yeah, I see him.
 
 429
 00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,313
 Wait... Wait till he passes.
 
 430
 00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,065
 Okay, it's clear.
 
 431
 00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,320
 Here.
 
 432
 00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:16,617
 - What the hell is this?
 - It's all they had.
 
 433
 00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:19,787
 If this is all they had,
 you're in the wrong place.
 
 434
 00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:21,288
 Just put it on.
 
 435
 00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:23,415
 Should've... Of course.
 
 436
 00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:32,091
 Okay, okay.
 
 437
 00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,594
 Okay. This is it.
 
 438
 00:30:37,054 --> 00:30:39,014
 Oh, God.
 
 439
 00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:52,903
 Okay.
 
 440
 00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:56,031
 - Get...
 - What?
 
 441
 00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,158
 - Look.
 - What?
 
 442
 00:30:58,575 --> 00:30:59,994
 Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping...
 
 443
 00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,455
 He's not supposed to come back.
 What's he doing?
 
 444
 00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:05,165
 Oh, my God.
 
 445
 00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,876
 ''Hope everything comes out all right. ''
 
 446
 00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:11,338
 - He's going to the crapper.
 - Oh, God.
 
 447
 00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,550
 - Okay. You coming, man? Come on.
 - What are you doing?
 
 448
 00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,959
 Okay, there it is.
 
 449
 00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:53,213
 Is this gonna be loud?
 
 450
 00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,008
 You'll find out in about 10 seconds.
 
 451
 00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,218
 Stand back.
 
 452
 00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:02,431
 Jesus.
 
 453
 00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:15,903
 Come on, come on.
 
 454
 00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,908
 Hey, what's going on?
 
 455
 00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:27,331
 - Where are the gallon jugs?
 - I don't...
 
 456
 00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,959
 - God!
 - What?
 
 457
 00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,503
 Let's just take this.
 Come on, come on.
 
 458
 00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,421
 What the...?
 
 459
 00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,840
 Damn it.
 
 460
 00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,306
 What are you doing
 opening the door?
 
 461
 00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:47,601
 - How are we gonna take this thing out?
 - Come on. Take that.
 
 462
 00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,645
 Lift.
 
 463
 00:32:50,354 --> 00:32:52,564
 - God.
 - Jeez.
 
 464
 00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:56,485
 Hey. Somebody?
 
 465
 00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,571
 ''- Billy, you back from the crapper yet?''
 - Let me out of here.
 
 466
 00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:03,742
 - I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
 ''- The alarm's going off. Check it out. ''
 
 467
 00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,786
 ''Billy?''
 
 468
 00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,289
 ''- Billy?''
 - Jimmy?
 
 469
 00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:09,748
 Help!
 
 470
 00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,682
 - Come on, let me try.
 - How is it gonna be any different?
 
 471
 00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,600
 - Can I just try it?
 - Fine, go ahead.
 
 472
 00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,145
 Jesus. Okay.
 
 473
 00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:33,355
 All right.
 
 474
 00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:43,240
 Yeah, baby. See?
 Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.
 
 475
 00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,117
 - Yeah, okay.
 - I'm the king.
 
 476
 00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,873
 No. No, no. That didn't sound good.
 
 477
 00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,419
 Oh, God.
 
 478
 00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,422
 Well, this thing's
 not going anywhere.
 
 479
 00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:02,301
 We're not cooking
 in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.
 
 480
 00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,266
 God.
 
 481
 00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,977
 What part of "slow it down"
 did you not understand?
 
 482
 00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:16,231
 What are you talking...? I'm...
 It's heavy, man. It got away from me.
 
 483
 00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:19,526
 Okay. All right.
 Now, that's good, that's good.
 
 484
 00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,820
 Now just bring it up, bring it up.
 
 485
 00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,074
 Easy, easy, easy. Okay.
 
 486
 00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,744
 Your real estate agent,
 when is she supposed to come back?
 
 487
 00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:30,371
 Oh, shit.
 
 488
 00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,957
 Yeah. I don't know.
 
 489
 00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,708
 I'll make damn sure she doesn't.
 
 490
 00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:39,797
 Good call, yo.
 
 491
 00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:17,501
 Keep the temperature steady
 at 425 degrees.
 
 492
 00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:21,255
 We'll need to run it two more hours...
 
 493
 00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,924
 ...to have enough to make
 4 and a half pounds.
 
 494
 00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:26,218
 Four and a half, not four?
 
 495
 00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,430
 2 pounds pays, two go back.
 
 496
 00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,143
 4 and a half pounds
 puts us $44,000 ahead.
 
 497
 00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,271
 - Each.
 - Right on, man.
 
 498
 00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:38,731
 Right on.
 
 499
 00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:41,608
 With the amount of methylamine
 that we got last night...
 
 500
 00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,820
 ...we can make
 4 and a half pounds a week for...
 
 501
 00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,489
 ...well, for the foreseeable future.
 
 502
 00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,285
 How long is that gonna be?
 
 503
 00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:55,623
 I mean, in your situation.
 
 504
 00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,250
 How much cash do you need?
 
 505
 00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:01,420
 More.
 
 506
 00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,927
 Someone's in the yard.
 
 507
 00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:13,182
 Yeah, this is definitely the one.
 
 508
 00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:14,683
 It's pretty.
 
 509
 00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,978
 Actually, I like it.
 
 510
 00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,189
 We could pull that out
 and put in a closet.
 
 511
 00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:23,150
 Just a little...
 We'll have to bring that down.
 
 512
 00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,111
 I thought you didn't like
 that type of thing.
 
 513
 00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,989
 Oh, no. No, I don't.
 
 514
 00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,492
 Right, right.
 
 515
 00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:40,501
 Was there, by any chance, scheduled
 for this afternoon, an open house?
 
 516
 00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:44,129
 - I left her a message. It's not my fault.
 - I don't care how you do it...
 
 517
 00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,674
 ...just keep them out of here.
 Do you understand?
 
 518
 00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,634
 - Yeah.
 - All right, go.
 
 519
 00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:12,324
 Absolutely.
 
 520
 00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:19,999
 You know, you can't duck me forever.
 
 521
 00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:21,458
 What?
 
 522
 00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,877
 Come on, I left you, like,
 15 messages.
 
 523
 00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,547
 When I went to your office,
 you snuck out the back.
 
 524
 00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:29,633
 I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.
 
 525
 00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,844
 Skyler, what are you,
 the paranoid police?
 
 526
 00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:36,348
 You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
 never been so humiliated in my life.
 
 527
 00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,142
 That...
 
 528
 00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:41,979
 That tiara.
 
 529
 00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:46,191
 They accused me, at Zachary's,
 of shoplifting it.
 
 530
 00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:48,819
 What were you doing at Zachary's?
 
 531
 00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,447
 I was returning it.
 
 532
 00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,533
 You were returning it.
 
 533
 00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,744
 Why would you return it?
 
 534
 00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,330
 It just wasn't...
 
 535
 00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:03,584
 Marie, what is wrong with you?
 Can you please tell me that?
 
 536
 00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,879
 Can you tell me
 why you'd do such a thing?
 
 537
 00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,302
 What does that mean?
 Does that mean you don't know?
 
 538
 00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:20,643
 That... means that I have no idea
 what the hell you're even talking about.
 
 539
 00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,854
 You have no idea
 what I'm talking about.
 
 540
 00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,606
 The shop...
 
 541
 00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:29,652
 The shoplifting. No idea?
 
 542
 00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:34,657
 You're not going to admit this,
 are you?
 
 543
 00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:39,161
 I can't really admit to something...
 
 544
 00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:43,207
 ...when I have no knowledge
 of what it is that I'm admitting.
 
 545
 00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:02,351
 - Would you like that gift-wrapped?
 - Yes, actually.
 
 546
 00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,728
 Don't forget to sign in.
 
 547
 00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,069
 - Thank you.
 - Thank you.
 
 548
 00:39:14,238 --> 00:39:16,031
 You're right.
 
 549
 00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:19,326
 Look at this wall here.
 
 550
 00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:33,215
 Excuse me,
 I'd just like to see the basement.
 
 551
 00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:36,635
 - Yeah, well, it's occupied.
 - It's not a bathroom.
 
 552
 00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:40,014
 I just want to see the basement.
 What's the big deal?
 
 553
 00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,974
 You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.
 
 554
 00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:45,144
 You got that? Is that sinking in?
 Now, beat it.
 
 555
 00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,479
 All you all, house is not for sale.
 
 556
 00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,732
 Get the hell out.
 
 557
 00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,398
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 
 558
 00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,028
 So how was it?
 
 559
 00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,366
 Was it an experience?
 
 560
 00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:42,034
 Yeah.
 
 561
 00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,120
 It was definitely an experience.
 
 562
 00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,670
 What's that smell?
 
 563
 00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,799
 Oh, yeah, it's...
 
 564
 00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:59,677
 ...sacred Navajo herbs.
 
 565
 00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,595
 You know.
 
 566
 00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,361
 Hey, everything okay?
 
 567
 00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,071
 No.
 
 568
 00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:21,031
 Not really.
 
 569
 00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,702
 Actually, not at all.
 
 570
 00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,874
 You know that tiara
 that Marie gave us?
 
 571
 00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:36,755
 - Yeah.
 - Well, she stole it. Yep.
 
 572
 00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:40,926
 I practically got arrested
 trying to return it at the store.
 
 573
 00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,469
 Oh, my God.
 
 574
 00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:46,682
 I mean, she refuses to admit it.
 She refuses to apologise.
 
 575
 00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,934
 I don't know what to do.
 
 576
 00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:59,320
 People sometimes
 do things for their families.
 
 577
 00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:05,034
 People sometimes
 do things for their families?
 
 578
 00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,203
 And what, that justifies stealing?
 
 579
 00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,290
 Well...
 
 580
 00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:15,127
 That must've been
 some sweat lodge.
 
 581
 00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:19,423
 Are you even listening to the words
 coming out of your mouth?
 
 582
 00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:25,679
 What would you do if it were me?
 
 583
 00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,933
 What do you mean, if it were you?
 
 584
 00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,313
 If it were me, what would you do?
 Would you divorce me?
 
 585
 00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,317
 Would you turn me in to the police?
 
 586
 00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,912
 You don't want to find out.
 
 587
 00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:03,342
 You want something to eat?
 
 588
 00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:09,014
 No, thanks.
 
 589
 00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,242
 What is this shit? This is blue.
 
 590
 00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:33,706
 We used a different chemical process,
 but it is every bit as pure.
 
 591
 00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:36,834
 It may be blue, but it's the bomb.
 
 592
 00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,511
 Tight, tight, tight, yeah.
 
 593
 00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:51,598
 Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man.
 Just keep bringing me that.
 
 594
 00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:03,944
 4.6.
 
 595
 00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,488
 Come on.
 
 596
 00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:10,826
 And what'd I say, man?
 This guy can cook.
 
 597
 00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:12,953
 You're all right, man. You're all right.
 
 598
 00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,748
 We're gonna make
 a lot of money together.
 
 599
 00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,710
 Just remember
 who you're working for.
 
 600
 00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:24,048
 What did you say?
 
 601
 00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:27,259
 I'm just saying, they gotta know
 that they're working for you.
 
 602
 00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,970
 Like they don't already know that?
 
 603
 00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:33,849
 Are you saying that they're stupid?
 
 604
 00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:37,311
 No, I'm just... I'm just saying.
 
 605
 00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:40,105
 Okay, so you're not saying
 that they're stupid.
 
 606
 00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:42,900
 So I don't understand.
 Are you saying that I'm stupid?
 
 607
 00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:46,028
 No, come on, Tuco. I'm just...
 I'm just saying.
 
 608
 00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:48,030
 No, you're just speaking for me!
 
 609
 00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:52,451
 Like I ain't got the goddamn sense
 to speak for myself!
 
 610
 00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:56,080
 Is that it? Is that what you're doing?
 
 611
 00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,040
 Tuco.
 
 612
 00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,583
 Tuco.
 
 613
 00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:05,005
 Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?
 
 614
 00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:15,265
 Heisenberg says "relax. "
 
 615
 00:45:21,105 --> 00:45:23,941
 I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.
 
 616
 00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:25,359
 I'm relax...
 
 617
 00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:44,211
 Damn, man! Look at that! Look!
 
 618
 00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:49,508
 That is messed up.
 
 619
 00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:53,470
 Okay, Heisenberg.
 
 620
 00:45:53,637 --> 00:45:55,431
 Next week.
