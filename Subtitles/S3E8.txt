 â€‹1
 00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,794
 Think you'll be okay
 waiting here by yourself?
 
 2
 00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,353
 Yeah, whatever.
 
 3
 00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,115
 Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
 to be another 20 feet from the door.
 
 4
 00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,192
 So roll me further, bitch.
 
 5
 00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,149
 What's coming?
 
 6
 00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,278
 Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
 Multiple gunshot wounds.
 
 7
 00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,720
 BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.
 
 8
 00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,634
 Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
 Weak and thready at the brachial.
 
 9
 00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,155
 No breath sounds on the right side,
 belly is rigid.
 
 10
 00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,709
 Appears pale and diaphoretic.
 How many entry wounds?
 
 11
 00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,075
 Four. Shoulder and hip,
 through and through.
 
 12
 00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,710
 Right lung in lower left quadrant,
 no visible... exit wounds.
 
 13
 00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,359
 Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.
 
 14
 00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,750
 - What's his haemoglobin?
 - Seven-point-three.
 
 15
 00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,279
 Need two large-bore IVs,
 six units O-neg.
 
 16
 00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,193
 Type and cross for six more units,
 chest x-ray and KUB.
 
 17
 00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,113
 Notify the OR, we are on the way.
 
 18
 00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,873
 OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.
 
 19
 00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,308
 Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.
 
 20
 00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,311
 Damn, brother, look at you.
 
 21
 00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
 That's messed up.
 
 22
 00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,115
 How are you feeling? You okay?
 
 23
 00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,078
 Actually...
 
 24
 00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,916
 ...I'm great.
 
 25
 00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,877
 I don't understand.
 
 26
 00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,110
 I thought things
 were going pretty well.
 
 27
 00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,870
 I thought we were kind of simpatico.
 
 28
 00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,555
 You know?
 We were becoming a real team.
 
 29
 00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
 Not... Not so much, no.
 
 30
 00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,353
 Is this about the temperature setting?
 I can assure you that will not happen...
 
 31
 00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,272
 No, it's bigger than that, Gale.
 
 32
 00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,069
 It's much more than that.
 
 33
 00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,034
 Could you elaborate?
 
 34
 00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,589
 Well, yes, of course I could...
 
 35
 00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,275
 ...but I don't think either of us...
 
 36
 00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,159
 ...would necessarily benefit
 from a prolonged...
 
 37
 00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,118
 Yeah, so...
 
 38
 00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,395
 Yeah.
 
 39
 00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,028
 I set up the... entire lab.
 
 40
 00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,471
 You said you liked the configuration.
 
 41
 00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,312
 And I do.
 
 42
 00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,512
 For the most part.
 
 43
 00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,397
 Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
 with a promising future.
 
 44
 00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,597
 It's just that I...
 
 45
 00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,518
 That we just have different rhythms,
 Gale.
 
 46
 00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,954
 You see... It's...
 
 47
 00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,673
 It's as if I'm classical...
 
 48
 00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,153
 ...but you are more jazz.
 
 49
 00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,798
 - Jazz.
 - Jazz. Yes.
 
 50
 00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,599
 And God knows
 there is nothing wrong with jazz.
 
 51
 00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,233
 It's simply that I require...
 
 52
 00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,994
 - Classical.
 - Exactly.
 
 53
 00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,915
 Oh, shit.
 
 54
 00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,998
 Man, this is the bomb.
 
 55
 00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,836
 What's up, partner?
 
 56
 00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,231
 - I can't believe this.
 - My replacement?
 
 57
 00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,356
 Oh, Jesus.
 
 58
 00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,909
 Hi. Gale.
 
 59
 00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,157
 - Nice to meet you.
 - What's up?
 
 60
 00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,754
 Man. We should've ditched that RV
 months ago.
 
 61
 00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,354
 It's all, like, shiny up in here.
 
 62
 00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,799
 I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
 I don't mean... I don't mean to be...
 
 63
 00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,832
 - This...
 - No.
 
 64
 00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,549
 - Makes no sense.
 
 65
 00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,277
 So I guess this is...
 
 66
 00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,909
 Oh, dear mother of God.
 
 67
 00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,076
 This is for the best.
 
 68
 00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,992
 Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?
 
 69
 00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,959
 Yeah.
 
 70
 00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,190
 Oh, man.
 
 71
 00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,031
 Mr. White.
 
 72
 00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,597
 Okay, there's a lot to show you.
 
 73
 00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,955
 Some new techniques to learn.
 
 74
 00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,396
 - What, now?
 - Yes, now.
 
 75
 00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,438
 We've only got a couple days
 before our next batch is due.
 
 76
 00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,238
 And I need to get you up to speed.
 
 77
 00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,110
 Right on. I'm just saying...
 
 78
 00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,076
 How's the cell service down here?
 
 79
 00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,798
 It's nonexistent.
 
 80
 00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,359
 We're shielded.
 
 81
 00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,750
 There's a hard line for emergencies.
 Come on.
 
 82
 00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,036
 So you haven't talked
 to anybody today...
 
 83
 00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,714
 ...other than, you know,
 Captain Nerd there.
 
 84
 00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,909
 Why?
 
 85
 00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,632
 Your brother-in-law.
 
 86
 00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,959
 What about him?
 
 87
 00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,276
 - What's the story?
 - He was unresponsive.
 
 88
 00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,476
 You getting exposure
 on those wounds?
 
 89
 00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,631
 - Two units of normal saline.
 - Bivalve mass.
 
 90
 00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,633
 Breath sounds bilaterally.
 Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.
 
 91
 00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,189
 Other one's not much better.
 Get those boots off.
 
 92
 00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,318
 See if you get a pulse.
 Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?
 
 93
 00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,549
 Where's that blood?
 
 94
 00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,549
 ''Dr. Bording to Cardiology.''
 
 95
 00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,995
 ''Dr. Bording to Cardiology.''
 
 96
 00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,270
 - Sir, can I help you?
 - Yeah, I...
 
 97
 00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,829
 - It's all right. He's family.
 - Thank you.
 
 98
 00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,235
 Marie. I'm so sorry.
 I'm so sorry, honey.
 
 99
 00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,349
 I'm so sorry.
 
 100
 00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,030
 I don't know what to say.
 
 101
 00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,716
 - How is he?
 - I don't know.
 
 102
 00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,678
 They won't really tell us anything.
 He's still in surgery.
 
 103
 00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,468
 They shot him four times.
 
 104
 00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,311
 Oh, Christ.
 
 105
 00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,916
 - Where's Holly?
 - I got a sitter.
 
 106
 00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,312
 - Hey, how are you, huh?
 - Fine.
 
 107
 00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,913
 Yeah?
 
 108
 00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,038
 Sure?
 
 109
 00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,151
 I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.
 
 110
 00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,432
 Okay.
 
 111
 00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,878
 - Here. Let me get the door.
 - I got it. I'm fine.
 
 112
 00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,839
 Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
 Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.
 
 113
 00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,952
 - Hello.
 - I'm very sorry.
 
 114
 00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,394
 Thank you.
 
 115
 00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,791
 Can you tell us anything
 or any details?
 
 116
 00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,428
 Right now, all we know
 is two men ambushed Hank.
 
 117
 00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,478
 They didn't have any ID on them.
 Probably Mexican nationals.
 
 118
 00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,915
 Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
 with the drug cartel.
 
 119
 00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,151
 Why did they attack Hank?
 
 120
 00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,719
 We're not sure yet.
 
 121
 00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,759
 It could be in relation to a investigation
 Hank was working...
 
 122
 00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,198
 ...or it could be a message
 to the DEA in general.
 
 123
 00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,839
 They had an axe.
 
 124
 00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,116
 The cartels tend to be dramatic.
 
 125
 00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,029
 Jesus.
 
 126
 00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,717
 - Where are they? I mean, did they...?
 - Hank got both of them.
 
 127
 00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,429
 He killed one outright, the other one's
 upstairs in critical condition.
 
 128
 00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,149
 Your brother-in-law's one tough
 son of a bitch to take them both out...
 
 129
 00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
 ...considering
 he didn't even have his gun.
 
 130
 00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,595
 He didn't have his gun?
 
 131
 00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,597
 Why didn't Hank have his gun?
 
 132
 00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,389
 Marie, the assault charge.
 
 133
 00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,233
 I had to suspend Hank
 pending the investigation.
 
 134
 00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,233
 That means
 I had to take away his weapon.
 
 135
 00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,879
 You had to take it.
 
 136
 00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,793
 - It's standard procedure. No one...
 - Okay. All right, listen.
 
 137
 00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,351
 If you all listened to him from the start
 and let him arrest that degenerate...
 
 138
 00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,954
 ...he wouldn't have taken things
 into his own hands.
 
 139
 00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,714
 And he would've had a gun
 and could've defended himself.
 
 140
 00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,075
 - Marie, let's just...
 - No. Just...
 
 141
 00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,832
 It's their fault.
 
 142
 00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,956
 He didn't have a gun.
 
 143
 00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,076
 Honey, this isn't helping you.
 
 144
 00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,832
 You.
 
 145
 00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,875
 What kind of partner are you?
 
 146
 00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,590
 You were supposed to back him up,
 and where were you?
 
 147
 00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,557
 Where were you?
 
 148
 00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,517
 Texas.
 
 149
 00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,513
 And you.
 
 150
 00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,717
 You're supposed
 to protect your agents...
 
 151
 00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,871
 ...instead of taking their guns...
 
 152
 00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,759
 ...not supporting them,
 not backing them up.
 
 153
 00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,353
 - Marie. Marie.
 - When they...
 
 154
 00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,911
 Honey, let's just go and sit down,
 okay?
 
 155
 00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,712
 I'm not doing anything until these two
 get the hell out of here. I mean it.
 
 156
 00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,793
 - Sorry...
 - Go.
 
 157
 00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,799
 You are not welcome here.
 
 158
 00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,158
 - The DEA is not welcome here.
 - Okay, honey.
 
 159
 00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,435
 Come on.
 
 160
 00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,875
 Come on. Let's go sit down.
 
 161
 00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,916
 It's not just them.
 
 162
 00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,834
 It's you, Walt.
 
 163
 00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,236
 This Pinkman
 that Hank was looking for...
 
 164
 00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,198
 ...Hank would have never
 even heard his name...
 
 165
 00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,955
 ...if you hadn't bought marijuana
 from him.
 
 166
 00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,918
 - Marie...
 - Do you ever think about that, Walt?
 
 167
 00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,718
 Do you?
 
 168
 00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,918
 Do you think about everything
 that you have put him through?
 
 169
 00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,071
 Marie, stop.
 
 170
 00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,238
 You're upset, and you're looking
 for someone to blame...
 
 171
 00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,039
 ...and it's understandable,
 but don't blame Walt.
 
 172
 00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,589
 It's not his fault.
 
 173
 00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,351
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 
 174
 00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,239
 - Sweetheart...
 - No. No. Don't...
 
 175
 00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,197
 - It's okay.
 - It's Hank.
 
 176
 00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,032
 It's all right.
 
 177
 00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,360
 All right, you're done.
 
 178
 00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,636
 Okay, next.
 
 179
 00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,078
 Hello.
 
 180
 00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,992
 Hello, hello, hello.
 
 181
 00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,793
 Yeah.
 
 182
 00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,230
 Yo, yo, yo.
 Jesse Pinkman in the house.
 
 183
 00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,389
 Oh, my dear God.
 
 184
 00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,794
 ''Walter White''
 ''to the nearest courtesy phone.''
 
 185
 00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,430
 ''Walter White,''
 ''please pick up a courtesy phone.''
 
 186
 00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,516
 ''Yo, we working sometime this year?''
 
 187
 00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,151
 What the hell are you thinking?
 Why are you calling me here?
 
 188
 00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,788
 Tried your cell
 and it went straight to voicemail.
 
 189
 00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,349
 - How am I to get a hold of you?
 - You aren't.
 
 190
 00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,318
 ''It's been a whole day.''
 ''How long is this grieving process?''
 
 191
 00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,072
 Just put a clock on it for me.
 
 192
 00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,994
 ''All I'm saying''
 ''is we have a schedule, right?''
 
 193
 00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,628
 My family
 comes before your schedule.
 
 194
 00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,756
 ''Dude, it's not my schedule.''
 
 195
 00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,118
 - We have responsibilities here.
 ''- I'll get there when I get there.''
 
 196
 00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,110
 You know what? Whatever.
 I'll just cook on my own.
 
 197
 00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,919
 - You will do no such thing.
 ''- Why not?''
 
 198
 00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,673
 ''Well, for starters...''
 
 199
 00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,718
 ''...you aren't the least bit familiar''
 ''with any of the equipment.''
 
 200
 00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,269
 ''There's gotta be some sort of manual,''
 ''right?''
 
 201
 00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,160
 - And I can read.
 ''- Jesse, touch nothing.''
 
 202
 00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,436
 ''Stop treating me''
 ''lik e I'm lik e your assistant.''
 
 203
 00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,036
 I'm not your bitch to order around.
 We're partners. Remember?
 
 204
 00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,150
 I need you to sit patiently and wait,
 I will be there as soon as I can.
 
 205
 00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,390
 Thank you very much
 for your kind words.
 
 206
 00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,269
 - We really do appreciate that.
 - What, is your wife there?
 
 207
 00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,271
 ''Yes. Yes, she is.''
 
 208
 00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,954
 She would be happy to know
 you asked about her.
 
 209
 00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,712
 Please do keep us in your thoughts.
 
 210
 00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,836
 Hey, tell your douche bag
 brother-in-law...
 
 211
 00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,991
 ...to head towards the light.
 
 212
 00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,234
 So I'm thinking maybe we should go
 get everybody some breakfast.
 
 213
 00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,029
 Yeah, that sounds good.
 Do you know who that was?
 
 214
 00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,239
 You know,
 these... eggs are really not too bad.
 
 215
 00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,596
 - Look at that.
 - Look at what?
 
 216
 00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,752
 At what? This. These spots.
 
 217
 00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,514
 This fork is absolutely filthy.
 
 218
 00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,797
 Tell me you see this.
 You've got good eyes. Look at that.
 
 219
 00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,157
 Marie, those are just water spots.
 
 220
 00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,309
 That's fine.
 
 221
 00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,910
 Those are not "water spots."
 
 222
 00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,991
 That's dirt.
 
 223
 00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,357
 This silverware's
 obviously not been cleaned.
 
 224
 00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,035
 It's covered in germs
 from someone... else's mouth.
 
 225
 00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,350
 God knows what.
 
 226
 00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,195
 Seriously, Aunt Marie,
 it's water spots.
 
 227
 00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,272
 Ours at home aren't any better.
 
 228
 00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,238
 Yours at home are irrelevant.
 We're in a hospital.
 
 229
 00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,437
 They need to be a higher standard.
 They have a responsibility.
 
 230
 00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,079
 Well, I'm not actually sure...
 
 231
 00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,994
 ...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
 as being part of the hospital.
 
 232
 00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,152
 It's in the same building.
 It's all under the same roof.
 
 233
 00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,833
 Do you think that sick people...
 
 234
 00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,560
 ...aren't eating
 with this bacteria-infested silverware?
 
 235
 00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,757
 My God, how are you supposed
 to survive this death trap?
 
 236
 00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,117
 Marie...
 
 237
 00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,393
 I survived.
 
 238
 00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,279
 I had my lobectomy at this hospital.
 
 239
 00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,032
 Remember that?
 
 240
 00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,309
 Remember how scared we all were?
 
 241
 00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,911
 I didn't wanna act like it,
 but I was terrified.
 
 242
 00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,189
 All that week, all I could think of...
 
 243
 00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,797
 ...was how they were actually
 going to cut me open...
 
 244
 00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,952
 ...and take out a part of me...
 
 245
 00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,157
 ...that was with me my entire life.
 
 246
 00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,470
 I couldn't get that image
 out of my head.
 
 247
 00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,959
 I think the scariest part
 was when they took me into pre-op.
 
 248
 00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,076
 Lying there,
 waiting for them to anesthetise you.
 
 249
 00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,468
 Knowing that you may never
 wake up again.
 
 250
 00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,110
 Actually what I really remember
 about that day...
 
 251
 00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,669
 ...is driving to the hospital.
 
 252
 00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
 Skyler, you remember me
 wanting to drive that day?
 
 253
 00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,832
 Yeah.
 
 254
 00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,675
 Anyway, there we are.
 We're driving up Central...
 
 255
 00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,877
 ...and we hit every green light.
 
 256
 00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,955
 I mean,
 every single light that we hit... green.
 
 257
 00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,310
 It's just... When does that happen?
 
 258
 00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,675
 Just like, bang, bang,
 green the... entire way.
 
 259
 00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,828
 And the whole time,
 all I could think about was:
 
 260
 00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,199
 "Why today? Why?
 Why can't I just spend...
 
 261
 00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,318
 ...a few extra minutes in the car
 with my family?"
 
 262
 00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,475
 I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
 so bad in my life.
 
 263
 00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,594
 At least I was with my family.
 
 264
 00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,272
 I had that.
 
 265
 00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,396
 Anyway, I survived this place.
 
 266
 00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,437
 And I'm not half the man
 your husband is.
 
 267
 00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,352
 Yes?
 
 268
 00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,636
 ''What the hell is going on up there?''
 
 269
 00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,792
 I was gonna ask you
 the same question.
 
 270
 00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,394
 You know about my men?
 
 271
 00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,075
 ''I heard that they attack ed a DEA agent.''
 ''Why would they do that?''
 
 272
 00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,074
 What's the matter?
 Spanish not good enough anymore?
 
 273
 00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,032
 I didn't order this, and my men
 would never do this on their own.
 
 274
 00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,839
 Someone gave the go-ahead.
 
 275
 00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,190
 ''Are you accusing me?''
 
 276
 00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,870
 I'm just saying
 they wouldn't act on their own.
 
 277
 00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,032
 I am not in the habit
 of picking my own pocket.
 
 278
 00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,277
 I assume that the next shipment
 will be delayed.
 
 279
 00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,796
 ''- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?''
 - A week, a month.
 
 280
 00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,873
 There's too much focus on the border.
 We lay low for the time being.
 
 281
 00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,110
 We lay low,
 and then we get the real story...
 
 282
 00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,713
 ...from my man who survived.
 
 283
 00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,599
 Your man is in custody.
 
 284
 00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,829
 God bless America!
 
 285
 00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,468
 He's innocent until proven guilty.
 Correct?
 
 286
 00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,312
 I'll get him the best lawyer...
 
 287
 00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,436
 ''...and then we'll learn the truth.''
 
 288
 00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,150
 Well, keep me apprised.
 
 289
 00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,989
 Any time you got that close proximity
 to the spine...
 
 290
 00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,390
 ...there's always gonna be cause
 for concern...
 
 291
 00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,233
 ...but as I say,
 it's really too soon to tell.
 
 292
 00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,868
 He's out of surgery, at least, which is...
 
 293
 00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,237
 - Out of surgery, on way to recovery.
 - All right. And where's that?
 
 294
 00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,356
 Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.
 
 295
 00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,590
 We're gonna have to wait
 for him to stabilize.
 
 296
 00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,276
 How long will that take?
 
 297
 00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,431
 I can't really say. It could be hours.
 
 298
 00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,751
 But we'll let you know
 just as soon as you can see him.
 
 299
 00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,873
 Thank you.
 
 300
 00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,359
 Maybe we should get you home
 for a couple hours?
 
 301
 00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,431
 Get some rest?
 
 302
 00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,070
 I'm not going anywhere.
 
 303
 00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,069
 Me neither.
 
 304
 00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,554
 Well, is anyone... else
 dying to brush their teeth...
 
 305
 00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,312
 ...or is it just me?
 
 306
 00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,679
 What if I ran over to the house
 and picked up a few things?
 
 307
 00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,308
 Marie? I could swing by your place.
 
 308
 00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,517
 That would be great. Thanks, Walt.
 
 309
 00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,793
 Okay.
 
 310
 00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,196
 Walt. Walt.
 
 311
 00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,316
 We just heard he came through.
 
 312
 00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,790
 Yeah, well, it's, you know,
 guardedly good news.
 
 313
 00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,837
 - Thank God. I'll take it.
 - Yeah.
 
 314
 00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,037
 Hey, guys,
 this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.
 
 315
 00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,270
 - Good to meet you. Hi.
 - Hey.
 
 316
 00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,830
 - We were just swapping Hank stories.
 - That could go on all day.
 
 317
 00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,150
 God knows,
 there's a million of them.
 
 318
 00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,036
 - Meanwhile...
 - Miserable piece of shit.
 
 319
 00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,709
 Guy who shot him, one that's left,
 he's up there.
 
 320
 00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,599
 Got the painkillers going on,
 resting comfortably.
 
 321
 00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,273
 Your tax dollars at work.
 
 322
 00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,830
 Gotta see what Hank did
 to that bastard.
 
 323
 00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,958
 Wanna see?
 
 324
 00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,634
 Come on, let me show you.
 
 325
 00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,551
 You comfortable, you piece of shit?
 
 326
 00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,754
 - You got him?
 - Come on.
 
 327
 00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,236
 - All right.
 - Easy now, easy.
 
 328
 00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,393
 Come here.
 
 329
 00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,959
 No.
 
 330
 00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,509
 Oh, shit.
 
 331
 00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,751
 Oh, sheesh.
 
 332
 00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,831
 Oh, sheesh.
 
 333
 00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,072
 One for you and two for...
 
 334
 00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,153
 Yeah.
 
 335
 00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,793
 Finally. About damn time.
 
 336
 00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,074
 Why isn't there anything cooking?
 
 337
 00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,511
 ''Walter White''
 ''to the nearest courtesy phone.''
 
 338
 00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,870
 ''- Operator.''
 - This is Walter White.
 
 339
 00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,712
 ''I'll connect you.''
 
 340
 00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,559
 ''Yo, we got problems, big ones.''
 
 341
 00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,315
 Reverend, so nice of you to call.
 Again.
 
 342
 00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,799
 Turn your phone on already.
 
 343
 00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,918
 ''You know,''
 ''I will definitely look into that.''
 
 344
 00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,789
 I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
 call you right back on my cell phone?
 
 345
 00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,313
 Okay?
 
 346
 00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,509
 I told you to wait. I don't know
 how many more ways I could say it.
 
 347
 00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,557
 ''Yeah, dick, I was waiting...''
 
 348
 00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,314
 ''...and then that creepy, quiet guy''
 ''showed up.''
 
 349
 00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,115
 - Gus came by?
 - Not him, man.
 
 350
 00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,510
 Apparently
 I'm not worthy of meeting him.
 
 351
 00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,274
 The other one.
 The one I'm qualified to speak to.
 
 352
 00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,919
 He started asking questions too.
 
 353
 00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,914
 ''Lik e why haven't we cook ed anything.''
 ''All right, we have a quota.''
 
 354
 00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,516
 It's due tomorrow.
 Do you seriously not care or what?
 
 355
 00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,478
 ''Because that guy,''
 ''he's got, lik e, the dead eyes.''
 
 356
 00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,834
 Let me ask you something.
 
 357
 00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,639
 Do you remember when we were
 out in the desert with Tuco?
 
 358
 00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,917
 Oh, you mean when he put
 a machine gun to my head?
 
 359
 00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,753
 Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
 Why?
 
 360
 00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,309
 No. He kept... He kept saying...
 
 361
 00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,995
 ...that someone was coming up
 from Mexico to get us.
 
 362
 00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,594
 Do you remember?
 Now, who was that?
 
 363
 00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,912
 What the hell has this got to do with...?
 Look, I don't know. It was...
 
 364
 00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,558
 His cousins.
 
 365
 00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,871
 Right, Jesse? It was...
 It was his cousins.
 
 366
 00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,474
 Yeah, cousins.
 
 367
 00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,153
 Whatever, man. Why?
 
 368
 00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,879
 Any news?
 
 369
 00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,792
 No change.
 
 370
 00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,312
 Okay, well, I didn't know
 whose toothbrushes were whose...
 
 371
 00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,358
 ...so I just stopped by the drugstore.
 
 372
 00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,837
 Thank God for travel sizes, right?
 
 373
 00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,399
 - Thank you.
 - Yeah.
 
 374
 00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,393
 Yeah.
 
 375
 00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,920
 Oh, I think I'm gonna
 go wash my face.
 
 376
 00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,036
 I'm going crazy.
 
 377
 00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,918
 - Do you wanna come?
 - Yeah.
 
 378
 00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,396
 ''Nurse Franklin,''
 ''please page the operator.''
 
 379
 00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,994
 ''Nurse Franklin, page the operator.''
 
 380
 00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,750
 I got candy bars.
 
 381
 00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,832
 Is this what you were asking for?
 
 382
 00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,956
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah?
 
 383
 00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,271
 Yeah, I skimmed through it.
 
 384
 00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,715
 - Looks interesting.
 - Yeah.
 
 385
 00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,909
 Uncle Hank gave it to me.
 
 386
 00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,836
 Well, what's it about?
 
 387
 00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,036
 Pablo Escobar,
 this big drug guy in the... 80s.
 
 388
 00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,158
 Yeah. Yeah.
 I remember seeing him on the news.
 
 389
 00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,116
 Well, it's more about the guys
 who investigated him...
 
 390
 00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,630
 ...and tried to bring him down.
 
 391
 00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,678
 Some of them were DEA, you know?
 
 392
 00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,830
 Uncle Hank said
 that they were worth learning about...
 
 393
 00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,959
 ...that everybody knows
 who Pablo Escobar is...
 
 394
 00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,669
 ...but nobody knows about the guys
 that brought him down.
 
 395
 00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,595
 I guess I never thought about it.
 
 396
 00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,318
 He said that good guys never get ink
 like the bad guys do.
 
 397
 00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,838
 So he gave it to me.
 
 398
 00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,555
 Figured I'd read it.
 
 399
 00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,876
 I need to...
 
 400
 00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,951
 - I'll be right back, okay?
 - Okay.
 
 401
 00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,678
 No, I assure you.
 We are hard at work. Absolutely.
 
 402
 00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,351
 ''So I can expect delivery by tomorrow''
 ''as scheduled.''
 
 403
 00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,473
 Well...
 
 404
 00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,918
 Unfortunately...
 
 405
 00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,718
 ''Unfortunately...''
 
 406
 00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,873
 ''...we're not going to be able''
 ''to k eep our schedule this week.''
 
 407
 00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,156
 But not for lack of trying.
 
 408
 00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,276
 Is there something I should know?
 
 409
 00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,149
 Well, to be completely honest
 with you...
 
 410
 00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,315
 ...Gale really screwed us up.
 
 411
 00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,359
 I mean, not on purpose, of course,
 but he just... He set us way back.
 
 412
 00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,159
 And we've been playing catch-up
 ever since.
 
 413
 00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,513
 And I've had to be out
 running errands...
 
 414
 00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,910
 ''...and trying to k eep us on target.''
 
 415
 00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,239
 Some of the... equipment
 wasn't calibrated correctly...
 
 416
 00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,233
 Well, it's just all very technical
 and boring.
 
 417
 00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,392
 But rest assured that...
 
 418
 00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,755
 That we will do whatever it takes.
 
 419
 00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,118
 ''It has my total attention.''
 
 420
 00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,396
 ''We'll cook through week end''
 ''if necessary.''
 
 421
 00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,352
 We will have 400 pounds for you
 by next week.
 
 422
 00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,438
 I have your word on that?
 
 423
 00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,956
 You do. You have my word on that.
 
 424
 00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,435
 ''Thank you for the update.''
 
 425
 00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,833
 Yeah. Right.
 
 426
 00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,553
 Any news?
 
 427
 00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,474
 No, I'm just wandering.
 
 428
 00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,796
 - How's everybody doing?
 - Well, as well as can be... expected.
 
 429
 00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,872
 It's this not knowing...
 
 430
 00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,349
 ...that's the hardest part, I think.
 
 431
 00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,029
 Anything new on these guys?
 
 432
 00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,111
 Who they are? What they wanted?
 
 433
 00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,034
 No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.
 
 434
 00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,712
 Steve...
 
 435
 00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,358
 Do you think
 there could maybe be others?
 
 436
 00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,392
 Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.
 
 437
 00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,790
 That was their one shot
 and they blew it.
 
 438
 00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,155
 So no.
 
 439
 00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,638
 No way.
 
 440
 00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,273
 Jesus.
 
 441
 00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,876
 I'd love to walk in there and shoot
 that bastard right in the head.
 
 442
 00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,598
 Me too.
 
 443
 00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,113
 Yeah?
 
 444
 00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,834
 Oh, yeah?
 
 445
 00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,434
 Great. We'll be right down.
 
 446
 00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,828
 Food's here.
 
 447
 00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,877
 Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?
 
 448
 00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,508
 - You guys coming?
 - Yeah.
 
 449
 00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,193
 - On occasion, yeah.
 - Owner's a big booster for the DEA.
 
 450
 00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,557
 He heard what happened. He's gonna
 feed every cop in the building.
 
 451
 00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,189
 - That's wonderful.
 - Yeah.
 
 452
 00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,193
 And, apparently,
 he's bringing it by personally.
 
 453
 00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,238
 - I don't even know what to say.
 - That's an incredible...
 
 454
 00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,960
 - Good, huh?
 - Delicious.
 
 455
 00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,918
 That's so generous of you.
 Thank you very much.
 
 456
 00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,355
 Yes, thank you.
 Guys, did you hear that?
 
 457
 00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,114
 Mr. Fring is offering
 a 10,000-dollar reward...
 
 458
 00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,236
 ...on any information about the case.
 
 459
 00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,029
 Well, that's... That's wonderful.
 
 460
 00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,111
 Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.
 
 461
 00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,794
 You're very welcome.
 Men like your husband...
 
 462
 00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,679
 ...are thin blue line
 between us and these animals.
 
 463
 00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,159
 I only wish I could do more.
 
 464
 00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,591
 Well, we do appreciate your support.
 
 465
 00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,038
 This reward could turn the tide here.
 It'll really help.
 
 466
 00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,997
 Again,
 I can't express how sorry I am.
 
 467
 00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,310
 As it happens,
 I actually met Agent Schrader.
 
 468
 00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,354
 - Really?
 - Our fund run, couple of months ago.
 
 469
 00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,353
 Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.
 
 470
 00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,951
 I talked for a few minutes
 with your husband.
 
 471
 00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,837
 As a matter of fact,
 Mr. White, your name came up.
 
 472
 00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,313
 Really?
 
 473
 00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,789
 Yeah, there happened to be
 a collection jar out for you...
 
 474
 00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,633
 ...and we spoke briefly
 about your health concerns.
 
 475
 00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,712
 I hope that there's been good news.
 
 476
 00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,550
 Things have improved, yes.
 
 477
 00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,870
 That's wonderful to hear.
 
 478
 00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,278
 It was clear to me
 how deeply he cares for you.
 
 479
 00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,239
 Well, I have taken up
 enough of your time.
 
 480
 00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,917
 Thank you again very much.
 It was a great pleasure to meet you.
 
 481
 00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,036
 - Thank you.
 - Yes, thank you.
 
 482
 00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,231
 - Let me walk you out.
 - Oh, no, it's not necessary.
 
 483
 00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,513
 You know, I didn't say thank you.
 
 484
 00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,478
 I'll walk him out. Be right back.
 
 485
 00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,836
 Good to see you.
 Enjoying the chicken?
 
 486
 00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,594
 - Good. Good... Hey.
 - Excuse me.
 
 487
 00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,991
 My pleasure. My pleasure, yeah.
 
 488
 00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,639
 - Excuse me.
 - Thank you.
 
 489
 00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,597
 It's good chicken, huh? Yeah. Good.
 
 490
 00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,830
 - Mr. Fring.
 - Mr. White.
 
 491
 00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,231
 - I just wanted to thank you again.
 - It's my pleasure.
 
 492
 00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,279
 May I...? May I speak with you?
 Just a moment.
 
 493
 00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,112
 You knew.
 
 494
 00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,796
 You knew my brother-in-law
 was with the DEA.
 
 495
 00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,073
 I investigate... everyone
 with whom I do business.
 
 496
 00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,750
 What careful man wouldn't?
 
 497
 00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,637
 He is not a problem for us,
 for our business.
 
 498
 00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,589
 Your being here is...
 
 499
 00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,950
 Is this some sort of message?
 
 500
 00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,350
 I'm supporting my community.
 
 501
 00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,159
 I hide in plain sight, same as you.
 
 502
 00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,038
 - Are we done?
 - No, listen, I...
 
 503
 00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,431
 This attack on my brother-in-law,
 I don't understand it.
 
 504
 00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,431
 I don't know what it means.
 
 505
 00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,556
 Please,
 if you have some knowledge...
 
 506
 00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,870
 ...that you could share with me...
 
 507
 00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,396
 I fear for my family.
 
 508
 00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,914
 I'm sure they'll be fine.
 
 509
 00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,710
 I am told the assassin that survived
 is gravely injured.
 
 510
 00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,950
 It's doubtful he'll live.
 
 511
 00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,873
 Now thank me and shake my hand.
 
 512
 00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,878
 - Thank you. Thank you again.
 - You're quite welcome, Mr. White.
 
 513
 00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,034
 Did you hear that?
 
 514
 00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,115
 - We're going up?
 - Come on.
 
 515
 00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,112
 What's going on?
 
 516
 00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,592
 What's happening?
 
 517
 00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,276
 Starting chest compressions.
 One, two, three, four.
 
 518
 00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,159
 - One, two, three...
 - Defib?
 
 519
 00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,118
 Patient is in asystole.
 Continuing chest compressions.
 
 520
 00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,119
 One, two, three, four.
 
 521
 00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,589
 - Give me a litre of saline.
 - I can't get a pulse.
 
 522
 00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,234
 One, two, three, four.
 
 523
 00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,472
 - Still nothing.
 - All right, stopping compressions.
 
 524
 00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,835
 - Time?
 - Eight forty-three.
 
 525
 00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,956
 Time of death, 20:43.
 
 526
 00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,912
 Burn in hell, you piece of shit.
 
 527
 00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,472
 Yes? Juan?
 
 528
 00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,312
 ''I assume you heard the news.''
 
 529
 00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,040
 Your man died. I heard.
 
 530
 00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,668
 - It's unfortunate.
 ''- Yeah, unfortunate.''
 
 531
 00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,593
 And meanwhile, I have Federales
 surrounding my house.
 
 532
 00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,309
 You know what I think, Gustavo?
 I think you're behind all this.
 
 533
 00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,677
 Why would I do this?
 
 534
 00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,912
 - How would it see... me?
 - That's the part I'm trying to figure out.
 
 535
 00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,150
 Go off on your own, maybe.
 
 536
 00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,237
 Would you actually think
 that would work?
 
 537
 00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,039
 ''Juan, you sound lik e''
 ''you're under a lot of stress.''
 
 538
 00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,078
 You should call me back when
 you're seeing things more clearly.
 
 539
 00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,798
 I see things clear enough.
 
 540
 00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,396
 One DEA gets shot,
 all of Washington starts barking.
 
 541
 00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,596
 D.F. Suddenly has to put
 on a big show...
 
 542
 00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,399
 ''...and I wind up with Federales''
 ''in my rosebushes.''
 
 543
 00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,198
 ''But just for a while.''
 
 544
 00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,229
 Appearances, politics.
 
 545
 00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,353
 ''Are you still there, Gustav o?''
 
 546
 00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,078
 Yes.
 
 547
 00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,475
 I'm here.
 
 548
 00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,078
 ''I'll weather this. I always do.''
 
 549
 00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,719
 My brother's a police chief.
 
 550
 00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,394
 I got connections.
 They'll get me through.
 
 551
 00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,676
 And when I get proof...
 
 552
 00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,559
 ...and the others find out
 what you've done...
 
 553
 00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,634
 ...maybe we come pay you a visit.
 
 554
 00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
 ''Maybe we can...''
 
 555
 00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,233
 Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.
 
 556
 00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,075
 Oh, how is he?
 Tell me something good.
 
 557
 00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,471
 I think he's stable... enough now
 for you to go see him briefly.
 
 558
 00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,995
 I'm sorry,
 I'm afraid it's immediately family only.
 
 559
 00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,071
 - We're all family.
 - I understand.
 
 560
 00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,118
 But we have a certain protocol here
 that we need...
 
 561
 00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,635
 We're all family.
