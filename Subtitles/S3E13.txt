 â€‹1
 00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,279
 - Well, hello there.
 - Hi, I hope we're not too late.
 
 2
 00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,032
 - No, no. Perfect timing.
 - Okay.
 
 3
 00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,111
 - Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
 - Hi.
 
 4
 00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,191
 - Good to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you.
 
 5
 00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,351
 - Sandia Laboratories, huh?
 - Yeah.
 
 6
 00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,988
 I hear some fascinating stuff
 goes on out there.
 
 7
 00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,718
 Yeah, well, you know.
 
 8
 00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,871
 Working on anything
 you can talk about?
 
 9
 00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,793
 I'm picturing giant space lasers.
 Am I right?
 
 10
 00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,713
 Honestly, what I do
 would bore you senseless.
 
 11
 00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,396
 Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
 I'll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.
 
 12
 00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,597
 - Well, just remember I get a cut.
 - All right. It's a deal.
 
 13
 00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,752
 So this is it, honey. What do you say?
 Wanna take a tour?
 
 14
 00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,831
 - Sure.
 - Okay.
 
 15
 00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,712
 Look, how about
 I give ya'll some privacy?
 
 16
 00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,237
 I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
 Take as much time as you need.
 
 17
 00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,069
 - All right.
 - Okay, thanks.
 
 18
 00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,109
 - He's actually a nice guy. He doesn't push.
 - Yeah.
 
 19
 00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,751
 So as you can see,
 there's a kind of flow going on here.
 
 20
 00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,751
 - It's a nice big living room.
 - Yeah.
 
 21
 00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,515
 And this is the dining area.
 
 22
 00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,832
 - Oh, the dining area. Right.
 - Yes. Oh, and...
 
 23
 00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,879
 ...it's got a pool.
 
 24
 00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,600
 Pool is nice.
 
 25
 00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,479
 Backyard could be a little bigger.
 
 26
 00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,475
 And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
 kind of dealie here, which is nice.
 
 27
 00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,473
 And, I don't know,
 the kitchen's really spacious...
 
 28
 00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,393
 ...and, you know,
 got good appliances and...
 
 29
 00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,232
 How many bedrooms?
 
 30
 00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,231
 Three. Told you.
 
 31
 00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,359
 They're all pretty good size and...
 Oh, this is the first one here.
 
 32
 00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,875
 And then there's two more
 at the back.
 
 33
 00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,951
 Only three bedrooms?
 
 34
 00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,759
 I think we're gonna need at 
 least five, don't you think?
 
 35
 00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,399
 - Five?
 - Yeah.
 
 36
 00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,154
 What, do I look like
 I'm about to drop a litter?
 
 37
 00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,474
 No, no, no.
 We'll have three kids total, eventually.
 
 38
 00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,108
 Yeah, but we'll need
 a spare room for a study...
 
 39
 00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,317
 ...so that I can work at home
 and you can write.
 
 40
 00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,112
 Yeah, no.
 I don't think this is gonna be... enough.
 
 41
 00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,073
 Okay, what about a wine cellar?
 
 42
 00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,915
 I mean, we certainly cannot be
 expected to live without a wine cellar.
 
 43
 00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,959
 Very funny. I just think we need
 to set our sights high is all.
 
 44
 00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,875
 - At least, higher than here.
 - Walt, this is a good neighbourhood.
 
 45
 00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,077
 It's got a good elementary
 and supposedly a very good high school...
 
 46
 00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,030
 ...and believe me, 'cause I have
 definitely looked everywhere.
 
 47
 00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,839
 For our price range,
 this is as good as it gets.
 
 48
 00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,878
 Well, then let's stretch our price range.
 
 49
 00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,678
 Truly. I mean, why...?
 
 50
 00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,879
 Why buy a starter house when we'll
 have to move out in a year or two?
 
 51
 00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,315
 Did you win the lottery
 and not tell me?
 
 52
 00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,232
 I'm serious.
 
 53
 00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,710
 Come on. Why be cautious?
 
 54
 00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,678
 We've got nowhere to go but up.
 
 55
 00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,678
 - Yeah.
 ''- Walter, you see us?''
 
 56
 00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,319
 Yeah. I see you.
 
 57
 00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,232
 ''I'd like you to exit your vehicle''
 ''and start walking toward us.''
 
 58
 00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,109
 And then what?
 I'm gonna need some...
 
 59
 00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,279
 ...some kind of assurance.
 
 60
 00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,319
 ''I assure you,''
 ''I could kill you from way over here...''
 
 61
 00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,074
 ''...if it makes you feel any better.''
 
 62
 00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,508
 Walter, you've been busy.
 
 63
 00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,355
 You wanna put your arms out
 to your sides for me, if you would?
 
 64
 00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,399
 You know I haven't slept
 since Thursday?
 
 65
 00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,438
 I was out all night
 cleaning up after you.
 
 66
 00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,352
 I need my sleep.
 
 67
 00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,434
 You said no half measures.
 
 68
 00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,038
 Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
 to interpretation.
 
 69
 00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,037
 - You get your car fixed?
 - Not yet.
 
 70
 00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,430
 You're gonna wanna
 get your car fixed.
 
 71
 00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,398
 Let's see how this goes first.
 
 72
 00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,749
 Has your condition worsened?
 
 73
 00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,640
 - Excuse me?
 - Your medical condition.
 
 74
 00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,633
 - Has it grown worse?
 - Not that I know of, no.
 
 75
 00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,314
 Is there a ringing in your ears?
 
 76
 00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,914
 Are you seeing bright lights
 or hearing voices?
 
 77
 00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,632
 - I'm quite well, thank you.
 - No. Clearly, you are not.
 
 78
 00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,031
 No rational person would do
 as you have done.
 
 79
 00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,913
 Explain yourself.
 
 80
 00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,670
 My partner was about
 to get himself shot.
 
 81
 00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,273
 I intervened.
 
 82
 00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,795
 Some worthless junkie.
 
 83
 00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,953
 For him, you intervened
 and put us all at risk.
 
 84
 00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,795
 Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
 keep the peace for eight hours.
 
 85
 00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,315
 That's right. He couldn't.
 
 86
 00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,909
 He was angry
 because those two dealers of yours...
 
 87
 00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,150
 ...had just murdered
 an 11-year-old boy.
 
 88
 00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,117
 I heard about it.
 
 89
 00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,953
 He should have
 let me take care of them.
 
 90
 00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,792
 Maybe.
 
 91
 00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,954
 Then again, maybe he thought
 it was you who gave the order.
 
 92
 00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,191
 Are you asking me
 if I ordered the murder of a child?
 
 93
 00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
 I would never ask you that.
 
 94
 00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,432
 Where is Pinkman now?
 
 95
 00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,470
 I wouldn't know.
 
 96
 00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,038
 Couple of time zones away, at least.
 
 97
 00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,478
 Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.
 
 98
 00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,918
 He has enough money to last forever,
 he knows he needs to keep moving.
 
 99
 00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,593
 You'll never find him.
 
 100
 00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,591
 I don't know, Walt...
 
 101
 00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
 ...it's what I do, after all.
 
 102
 00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,677
 He's out of the picture.
 
 103
 00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,753
 I saved his life, I owed him that,
 but now he and I are done.
 
 104
 00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,992
 Which is exactly what you wanted,
 isn't it?
 
 105
 00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,638
 You've always struck me
 as a very pragmatic man.
 
 106
 00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,156
 So if I may,
 I would like to review options with you.
 
 107
 00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,074
 Of which, it seems to me,
 you have two.
 
 108
 00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,157
 Option A:
 
 109
 00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,118
 You kill me right here and now.
 
 110
 00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,114
 Apparently,
 I have made that very easy for you.
 
 111
 00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,794
 You can kill me, no witnesses...
 
 112
 00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,635
 ...and then spend the next few weeks
 or months...
 
 113
 00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,519
 ...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
 and you kill him too.
 
 114
 00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,913
 A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
 but that is option A.
 
 115
 00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,672
 What is option B?
 
 116
 00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,193
 I continue cooking.
 
 117
 00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,115
 You and I both forget about Pinkman.
 
 118
 00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,475
 We forget this ever happened.
 
 119
 00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,200
 We consider this a Ione hiccup...
 
 120
 00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,990
 ...in an otherwise long
 and fruitful business arrangement.
 
 121
 00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,949
 I prefer option B.
 
 122
 00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,435
 You'd need a new assistant.
 
 123
 00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,715
 - I could get right on that.
 - No.
 
 124
 00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,030
 This time, I choose.
 
 125
 00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,158
 Your car...
 
 126
 00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,958
 ...get it fixed.
 
 127
 00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,633
 Yeah.
 
 128
 00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,196
 Really?
 
 129
 00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,113
 It's good to see you.
 
 130
 00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,438
 Thanks.
 
 131
 00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,516
 It's good to be back.
 
 132
 00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,271
 Well, shall we?
 
 133
 00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,274
 By all means, Gale, let's cook.
 
 134
 00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,352
 What about that rhinoceros?
 You think he'd make a good pet?
 
 135
 00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,078
 - No.
 - No?
 
 136
 00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,800
 Don't you think if you called to him,
 he'd come running for his supper?
 
 137
 00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,872
 I bet he would.
 I bet he'd come running:
 
 138
 00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,789
 You're silly, Pop-Pop.
 
 139
 00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,918
 Well, a little. But he'd probably
 knock everything over.
 
 140
 00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,517
 - Plus, there's that big nose of his.
 - That's not a nose, that's a horn.
 
 141
 00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,719
 - Is that so?
 - His real nose is little.
 
 142
 00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,036
 I learn all kinds of things
 being with you.
 
 143
 00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,031
 Okay, June bug, these are for you.
 
 144
 00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,430
 - What about the rest?
 - The rest are for me.
 
 145
 00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,034
 No, they're not.
 You're too old for balloons.
 
 146
 00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,428
 You're never too old for balloons.
 Give me a hug.
 
 147
 00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,796
 I see your mama.
 Don't keep her waiting.
 
 148
 00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,349
 - Bye, Pop-Pop.
 - Bye, baby.
 
 149
 00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,557
 Hi, sweetie.
 Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?
 
 150
 00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,918
 Please. Please, no.
 
 151
 00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,239
 Chow, you have anything
 you wanna tell me?
 
 152
 00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,039
 Thank God you're here.
 They keep me prisoner.
 
 153
 00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,954
 - They keep you prisoner.
 - I don't do nothing for them ever.
 
 154
 00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,157
 They try and make me. I say, no.
 
 155
 00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,235
 They steal my chemicals.
 I can't stop them. I am businessman.
 
 156
 00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,834
 You're a business...
 The lady out front...
 
 157
 00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,436
 Hey, lady, are you still there?
 Ask her if she's still there.
 
 158
 00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,119
 She says, yes.
 
 159
 00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,830
 How's her driving? Driving.
 Is she good behind the wheel?
 
 160
 00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,355
 Good. She's good driver.
 
 161
 00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,114
 Licensed? Dependable?
 
 162
 00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,554
 She has a Camry.
 
 163
 00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,229
 Good.
 
 164
 00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,993
 The trucks'll be here
 first thing in the morning.
 
 165
 00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,835
 I strongly recommend
 that you return our calls next time.
 
 166
 00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,116
 So have her drive you to the hospital.
 
 167
 00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,078
 She's gonna need her shoe.
 
 168
 00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,237
 - Where'd they cross?
 - Laredo, looks like.
 
 169
 00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
 They didn't exactly send
 their A players.
 
 170
 00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,032
 But like you said, it's cartel, all right.
 
 171
 00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,996
 Probing for weakness.
 
 172
 00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,629
 Well, they didn't find any.
 
 173
 00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,312
 What about Pinkman?
 
 174
 00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,640
 I'm making enquiries.
 
 175
 00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,515
 Yeah, that's two.
 All right, let's close it up.
 
 176
 00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,553
 All right, bring it down.
 
 177
 00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,192
 You ready?
 
 178
 00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,710
 Okay, we're good.
 
 179
 00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,520
 You can take your mask off now.
 
 180
 00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,951
 Does that guy ever leave?
 
 181
 00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,600
 When exactly did that start?
 
 182
 00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,917
 It's new.
 
 183
 00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,475
 We had a...
 
 184
 00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,029
 We had a little drama
 with the person you replaced.
 
 185
 00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,353
 - Sorry to hear that.
 - No, it'll be fine.
 
 186
 00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,637
 Things will continue
 to smooth out and...
 
 187
 00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,076
 Yeah, it'll be fine.
 
 188
 00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,797
 By the way, if you're at all worried
 about working with me...
 
 189
 00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,791
 No, I'm not.
 
 190
 00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,951
 Because whatever my shortcomings
 last time...
 
 191
 00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,271
 ...I intend for things to go perfectly
 from here on out.
 
 192
 00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,910
 - So if there is...?
 - Gale, you're great.
 
 193
 00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,674
 - Seriously.
 - I just...
 
 194
 00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,755
 However you like things to be done
 is exactly how we're gonna do them.
 
 195
 00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,717
 Period.
 
 196
 00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,277
 From here on out, so...
 
 197
 00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,793
 Please, teach me.
 
 198
 00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,838
 Okay.
 
 199
 00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,716
 Gale. It's good to see you.
 
 200
 00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,472
 Mr. Fring.
 
 201
 00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,198
 Wow, this is...
 
 202
 00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,511
 I should have called first.
 I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
 
 203
 00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,550
 No. No, no, not at all.
 Please, come in.
 
 204
 00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,835
 Can I offer you something?
 A crÃ¨me de menthe?
 
 205
 00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,594
 No. No, thank you.
 
 206
 00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,196
 I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
 
 207
 00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,399
 Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.
 
 208
 00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,234
 I need to talk to you
 about something.
 
 209
 00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,755
 Something rather pressing.
 
 210
 00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,350
 If push came to shove,
 I was wondering...
 
 211
 00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,274
 ...how soon you might be able
 to take over the lab yourself.
 
 212
 00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,556
 You and an assistant.
 
 213
 00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,878
 Why would...?
 
 214
 00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,073
 - Why would push come to shove?
 - Has Walter ever talked to you...
 
 215
 00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,710
 ...about why he got into
 this particular line of work?
 
 216
 00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
 I guess I assumed
 it was because it pays so well.
 
 217
 00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,800
 It is, but specifically...
 
 218
 00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,838
 ...has he ever spoken to you
 about his health problems?
 
 219
 00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,593
 I'm not surprised.
 He's a very private person.
 
 220
 00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,952
 What exactly
 are his health problems?
 
 221
 00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,270
 He's dying of cancer.
 
 222
 00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,515
 It is why he does this, to provide for
 his family, which he's accomplished.
 
 223
 00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,709
 They will never want for anything,
 he's seen to that.
 
 224
 00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,234
 How long does he have?
 
 225
 00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,354
 That is very much the question.
 
 226
 00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,713
 He does not wanna talk about it.
 And every time I bring it up with him...
 
 227
 00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,148
 I don't know that he's fully accepted
 the reality of it.
 
 228
 00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,915
 And not to sound cold-blooded,
 but I am running a business here.
 
 229
 00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,911
 - No, I understand.
 - I have a very large investment in this.
 
 230
 00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,117
 There's so much overhead
 that I can't afford to shut down.
 
 231
 00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,633
 Not even for a week.
 
 232
 00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,076
 So you understand my concern.
 
 233
 00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,198
 And my desire for continuity.
 
 234
 00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,759
 I do. Absolutely.
 
 235
 00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,993
 Now, I intend to keep Walter on
 as long as he wants...
 
 236
 00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,914
 ...assuming that
 he's physically up to it.
 
 237
 00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,598
 But as he cannot or will not tell me
 how long that might be...
 
 238
 00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,436
 ...I must prepare
 for the worst-case scenario.
 
 239
 00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,589
 Well, worst-case scenario...
 
 240
 00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,473
 I suppose if we had...
 
 241
 00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,799
 ...at least a few more cooks together.
 
 242
 00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,997
 You don't think you're ready now?
 
 243
 00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,276
 Well, I mean...
 
 244
 00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,874
 ...he is such a...
 
 245
 00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,149
 ...a master.
 
 246
 00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,469
 There's always more for me to learn.
 
 247
 00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,196
 But I'm thinking that if we had...
 
 248
 00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,032
 ...say...
 
 249
 00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,392
 ...one or two more cooks.
 
 250
 00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,957
 One more...
 
 251
 00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,875
 ...I guess would do it. I suppose.
 
 252
 00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,389
 I believe in you, Gale.
 
 253
 00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,919
 I know that when the time comes,
 you will be ready.
 
 254
 00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,914
 What's up?
 
 255
 00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,830
 Walt, is there...?
 
 256
 00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,993
 Any particular trick
 to purging the catalyst bed?
 
 257
 00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,751
 No, it's pretty straightforward.
 I'll show you when we get there.
 
 258
 00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,198
 Yeah?
 
 259
 00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,551
 Tell him I'm in conference.
 
 260
 00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,317
 - Can't you see I'm in conference?
 - I'm looking to find a client of yours.
 
 261
 00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,119
 I was hoping you could help me out
 with an address.
 
 262
 00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,317
 - Which client?
 - Jesse Pinkman.
 
 263
 00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,474
 Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
 Jesse Pinkman.
 
 264
 00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,030
 How would one track him down,
 I wonder.
 
 265
 00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,832
 - You're still here.
 - I need your full attention, Saul.
 
 266
 00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,077
 Jesse Pinkman.
 Current whereabouts.
 
 267
 00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,789
 The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can
 get back to whatever the hell this is exactly.
 
 268
 00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,111
 What am I, 8th-grade hall monitor?
 Current whereabouts?
 
 269
 00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,229
 - Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
 - Whoa, you are good right there.
 
 270
 00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,433
 Now, let's both get comfortable.
 
 271
 00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,270
 Now, when I say,
 I'm looking for Pinkman...
 
 272
 00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,670
 ...we both know why, don't we?
 
 273
 00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,073
 And you pretending otherwise only wastes
 my time and serves to annoy me.
 
 274
 00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,673
 Look, Mike...
 
 275
 00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,479
 ...there are rules to this lawyer thing.
 
 276
 00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,631
 - Is that right?
 - Yeah.
 
 277
 00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,075
 Attorney-client privilege.
 That's a big one.
 
 278
 00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,310
 That's something I provide for you.
 
 279
 00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,277
 So if I give up Pinkman...
 
 280
 00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,796
 ...then you're gonna be asking,
 "Old Saul gives them up pretty easy.
 
 281
 00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,428
 What's to keep him
 from giving me up?" You see?
 
 282
 00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,477
 So then, where's the trust?
 
 283
 00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,909
 I trust the hole in the desert
 I'd leave you in.
 
 284
 00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,397
 Yeah, that's an argument.
 
 285
 00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,477
 Saul...
 
 286
 00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,753
 ...don't make me beat you
 till your legs don't work.
 
 287
 00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,073
 Now tell me where to find him.
 You know it's the right thing.
 
 288
 00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,269
 I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...
 
 289
 00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,189
 Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
 I couldn't live with myself.
 
 290
 00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,998
 I'm sorry.
 
 291
 00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,715
 But who's to say I didn't write
 the address down in my day planner?
 
 292
 00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,236
 Or on a scratch piece of paper
 somewhere?
 
 293
 00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,234
 Who's to say
 I didn't write down a location...
 
 294
 00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,597
 ...strictly for
 my own professional use?
 
 295
 00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,675
 Do not touch anything on my desk.
 
 296
 00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,674
 I'm gonna leave the room,
 make myself a NescafÃ©.
 
 297
 00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,759
 I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
 Like a mother hen.
 
 298
 00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,872
 Believe me, money-laundering ain't what
 it used to be. God, do I miss the 80s.
 
 299
 00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,154
 You're wasting your time.
 I'm buying the car wash, end of story.
 
 300
 00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,949
 Well, one look at this place,
 you're gonna fall in love, so...
 
 301
 00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,672
 Was I right? Where else you gonna find
 a cash-only business that's this much fun?
 
 302
 00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,675
 Unless we're talking massage parlours,
 and, I don't see it. Shall we?
 
 303
 00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,473
 You ever actually play laser tag?
 
 304
 00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,549
 You know, it's good cardio.
 Plus, you get to shoot at kids.
 
 305
 00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,554
 You got your bumper cars over there
 down that way.
 
 306
 00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,280
 Got your arcade here,
 all the latest video games.
 
 307
 00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,274
 Snack bar's over there. Nothing stopping
 you from selling beer to the parents.
 
 308
 00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,389
 - That's a whole new revenue stream...
 - All right, already. We're good.
 
 309
 00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,153
 Holy Christ.
 
 310
 00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,278
 We're good? This constitutes good
 where you're from?
 
 311
 00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,159
 - My car is bugged?
 - I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.
 
 312
 00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,392
 I'm being followed?
 What the hell have you gotten me into?
 
 313
 00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,269
 My very own P.I. is threatening to break
 my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...
 
 314
 00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,512
 ...threatening that little prissy guy
 with the moustache.
 
 315
 00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,911
 Over and above.
 Service-wise, this is over and above.
 
 316
 00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,957
 You and I survive this...
 
 317
 00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,509
 ...I'm seriously rethinking
 my pricing, yeah.
 
 318
 00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,717
 And that goes double for you,
 Hip-Hop.
 
 319
 00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,678
 Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?
 
 320
 00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,038
 So I give us maybe 24 hours before he
 figures out that address goes nowhere.
 
 321
 00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,794
 You guys do your thing,
 make it snappy.
 
 322
 00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,236
 I'll go see if they have "Tetris"
 or something.
 
 323
 00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,556
 So how you holding up?
 
 324
 00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,872
 You?
 
 325
 00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,317
 I got my old job back.
 
 326
 00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,677
 At least until they kill me
 and Gale takes over.
 
 327
 00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,311
 - So he's their boy, huh?
 - He's their boy.
 
 328
 00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,789
 How long you think you've got?
 
 329
 00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,919
 Well, he asks a lot of questions
 about the cooking process.
 
 330
 00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,073
 I try to be as vague as possible,
 but I got that guy Victor watching me...
 
 331
 00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,708
 ...listening to every word I say.
 
 332
 00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,995
 You know, maybe that the only thing
 saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.
 
 333
 00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,915
 And once he feels confident
 that he knows my entire method...
 
 334
 00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,077
 So, what do we do?
 
 335
 00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,830
 You know what we do.
 
 336
 00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,513
 There's got to be some other way.
 
 337
 00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,629
 Maybe it's better for you
 to just go to the cops.
 
 338
 00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,828
 All right? I mean,
 I can't believe I'm saying that and all...
 
 339
 00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,911
 ...but for your family.
 
 340
 00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,993
 The DEA would love you,
 all the shit you could tell them.
 
 341
 00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,072
 Federal witness protection,
 that's a good deal.
 
 342
 00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,995
 As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
 I mean, I'll make it.
 
 343
 00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,472
 We had a good run.
 
 344
 00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,551
 But it's over.
 
 345
 00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,555
 Never the DEA.
 
 346
 00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,472
 The cook can't stop.
 
 347
 00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,792
 That's the one thing I'm certain of,
 production cannot stop.
 
 348
 00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,155
 Gus can't afford to.
 
 349
 00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,757
 So if I'm the only chemist
 that he's got...
 
 350
 00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,038
 ...then I've got leverage,
 and leverage keeps me alive.
 
 351
 00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,476
 It keeps you alive too.
 I think I can see to that.
 
 352
 00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,952
 If I'm the only chemist that he's got.
 
 353
 00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,913
 I can't do it, Mr. White.
 
 354
 00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,390
 Like you said, I'm...
 
 355
 00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,351
 I'm not a...
 
 356
 00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,836
 I can't do it.
 
 357
 00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,117
 I'll do it.
 
 358
 00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,996
 I'm gonna need your help.
 
 359
 00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,310
 I mean,
 they're watching me day and night.
 
 360
 00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,597
 They never leave me alone with Gale,
 not for a moment.
 
 361
 00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,274
 Hell, I don't even know
 where the man lives.
 
 362
 00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,076
 He's not in the phone book,
 I can't find him on the Internet...
 
 363
 00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,835
 ...and I can't do it in the lab,
 Victor's always there.
 
 364
 00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,756
 But if I could just...
 
 365
 00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,799
 ...shake Victor,
 for even an hour one night...
 
 366
 00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,269
 ...I think then that...
 
 367
 00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,955
 I may be able to...
 
 368
 00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,155
 ...make it look like an accident.
 
 369
 00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,477
 There's got to be some other way.
 
 370
 00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,390
 I'm all ears.
 
 371
 00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,271
 But when it comes down to you and me
 versus him, I'm sorry.
 
 372
 00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,915
 I'm truly sorry...
 
 373
 00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,035
 ...but it's gonna be him.
 
 374
 00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,509
 Now, you are the only edge
 that I've got...
 
 375
 00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,478
 ...as long as they don't know
 that you're in town.
 
 376
 00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,871
 But I need you to track him,
 get me his address.
 
 377
 00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,110
 And I'll do the rest.
 
 378
 00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,393
 Look, I saved your life, Jesse.
 
 379
 00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,035
 Are you gonna save mine?
 
 380
 00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,595
 ''Yeah?''
 
 381
 00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,398
 Please, tell me you found him.
 
 382
 00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,998
 ''6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.''
 ''Apartment 6.''
 
 383
 00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,799
 ''- You there?''
 - Yeah.
 
 384
 00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,079
 6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.
 
 385
 00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,711
 - He's home?
 ''- Yep.''
 
 386
 00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,115
 Anyone watching the place?
 
 387
 00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,670
 ''No. Looks pretty much wide-open.''
 
 388
 00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,036
 ''When are you gonna do it?''
 
 389
 00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,798
 Tonight.
 
 390
 00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,030
 Once it gets dark.
 
 391
 00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,077
 ''Don't do this, Mr. White.''
 
 392
 00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,233
 ''Please. Go to the cops.''
 
 393
 00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,159
 We got a problem.
 
 394
 00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,959
 Some kind of chemical leaking
 in your lab.
 
 395
 00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,758
 Better come with me.
 
 396
 00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,036
 I'll follow you.
 
 397
 00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,113
 They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
 Come on, get in the car.
 
 398
 00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,436
 I don't know if it's a barrel leak or what...
 
 399
 00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,751
 ...but you got something
 mighty stinky down there.
 
 400
 00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,191
 After you.
 
 401
 00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,319
 Walter, the sooner you figure out what
 this is, the sooner we all go home.
 
 402
 00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,796
 Please, don't do this.
 
 403
 00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,911
 Mike...
 
 404
 00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,589
 ...you don't have to do this.
 
 405
 00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,598
 Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.
 
 406
 00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,318
 Downstairs.
 
 407
 00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,598
 I'll cook. I'll cook for free, and there won't
 be any more trouble, I promise you.
 
 408
 00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,352
 - No.
 - If I could just talk to Gus...
 
 409
 00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,317
 - No.
 ...I know I can make him understand.
 
 410
 00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,710
 Please if I could talk to Gus,
 I can convince him, okay?
 
 411
 00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,677
 Just let me, please... Please.
 
 412
 00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,469
 - Please, let me talk to him.
 - Shut up! Shut up.
 
 413
 00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,269
 I can't do it. I'm sorry.
 
 414
 00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,311
 I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.
 
 415
 00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,836
 Okay? Like you said, he's the problem.
 He's always been the problem.
 
 416
 00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,629
 And without him, we would...
 And he's in town, all right?
 
 417
 00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,439
 He's not in Virginia or wherever
 the hell you're looking for him.
 
 418
 00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,751
 He's right here in Albuquerque
 and I could take you to him.
 
 419
 00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,195
 I'll take you right to him.
 
 420
 00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,672
 - What do you say?
 - Where is he?
 
 421
 00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,674
 - Right now, you give me an address.
 - I don't... He moves. He moves around.
 
 422
 00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,479
 But if you let me call him...
 No, no, please.
 
 423
 00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,234
 No, I just... My phone. I'll just...
 
 424
 00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,393
 It's just my phone. I'll call him
 and I'll have him meet me.
 
 425
 00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,676
 All right? Okay?
 
 426
 00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,432
 Okay?
 
 427
 00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,515
 Did you do it?
 
 428
 00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,957
 ''Mr. White?''
 
 429
 00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,191
 ''Did you do it?''
 
 430
 00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,557
 No, I didn't do it.
 
 431
 00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,468
 ''I can't now.''
 
 432
 00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,596
 ''- It's gonna have to be you.''
 - What? No way, man.
 
 433
 00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,797
 Listen to me. You're closer than we are.
 You'll have about a 20-minute lead.
 
 434
 00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
 ''They've got me at the laundry''
 ''and they're going to kill me.''
 
 435
 00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,830
 - Jesse, do it now! Do it fast!
 - Son of a bitch!
 
 436
 00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,228
 ''Do it, Jesse! Do it!''
 
 437
 00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,715
 Just what the hell was that exactly?
 
 438
 00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,598
 You might wanna hold off.
 
 439
 00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,159
 Yeah?
 
 440
 00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,075
 - Why?
 - Because your boss is gonna need me.
 
 441
 00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,631
 6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.
 
 442
 00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,075
 Yeah.
 
 443
 00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,028
 Hi. How can I help you?
 
 444
 00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,516
 Take whatever you want.
 
 445
 00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,995
 I have money. I have...
 
 446
 00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,674
 I got a lot of money.
 
 447
 00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,195
 I have...
 
 448
 00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,477
 Please, don't do this.
 
 449
 00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,076
 You don't... You...
 
 450
 00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,478
 You... You don't have to do this.
