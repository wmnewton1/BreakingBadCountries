 1
 00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,790
 What is this? It's blue.
 
 2
 00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,679
 We used a different chemical process,
 but it is every bit as pure.
 
 3
 00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,838
 It may be blue, but it's the bomb.
 
 4
 00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,072
 Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.
 
 5
 00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,916
 Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
 just keep bringing me that.
 
 6
 00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,477
 You're all right. We're gonna make
 a lot of money together.
 
 7
 00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,278
 Just remember
 who you're working for.
 
 8
 00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,592
 What did you say?
 
 9
 00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,473
 I'm just saying, they gotta know
 that they're working for you.
 
 10
 00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,150
 Like they don't already know that?
 
 11
 00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,873
 Are you saying that they're stupid?
 
 12
 00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,074
 No, I'm just saying.
 
 13
 00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,794
 Okay, so you're not saying
 that they're stupid?
 
 14
 00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,514
 So I don't understand.
 Are you saying that I'm stupid?
 
 15
 00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,073
 Is that it?
 
 16
 00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,191
 Is that what you're doing?
 
 17
 00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,437
 Tuco. Tuco.
 
 18
 00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,679
 Hey, why don't we all
 just relax, huh?
 
 19
 00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,470
 Heisenberg says relax.
 
 20
 00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,271
 I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela—21
 00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,474
 Damn, man! Look at that! Look!
 
 22
 00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,595
 Yeah, that's messed up.
 
 23
 00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,072
 Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.
 
 24
 00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,030
 Adjusting for inflation....
 
 25
 00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,834
 Good state college,
 adjusting for inflation...
 
 26
 00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,473
 ...say, $45,000 a year.
 
 27
 00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,391
 Two kids, four years of college,
 $360,000.
 
 28
 00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,434
 Remaining mortgage on the home,
 107,000.
 
 29
 00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,553
 Home equity line, 30,000.
 That's 137,000.
 
 30
 00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,389
 Cost of living, food, clothing,
 utilities...
 
 31
 00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,593
 ...say, 2 grand a month.
 
 32
 00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,156
 I mean, that should put a dent in it,
 anyway.
 
 33
 00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,957
 Twenty-four K a year,
 provide for, say, 10 years.
 
 34
 00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,439
 That's $240,000.
 Plus 360, plus 137.
 
 35
 00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,390
 Seven thirty-seven.
 
 36
 00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,359
 Seven hundred and thirty-seven
 thousand. That's what I need.
 
 37
 00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,755
 That is what I need.
 
 38
 00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,199
 You and I both clear
 about 70 grand a week.
 
 39
 00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,119
 That's only 10 and half more weeks.
 Call it 11.
 
 40
 00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,632
 Eleven more drug deals, and always
 in a public place from now on.
 
 41
 00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,790
 It's doable. Definitely doable.
 
 42
 00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,154
 No, no. Stop, stop, stop.
 
 43
 00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,229
 Heisenberg!
 
 44
 00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
 What the hell?
 What's wrong with him?
 
 45
 00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,748
 What's the matter with you?
 
 46
 00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,157
 You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?
 
 47
 00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,952
 -Oh, damn, Tuco.
 -Shut up!
 
 48
 00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,316
 There's no pulse.
 
 49
 00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,875
 -Do something.
 -Do something?
 
 50
 00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,310
 He needs an ambulance.
 He needs a hospital.
 
 51
 00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,795
 Do something! You're smart, right?
 
 52
 00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,274
 Do that—Do that thing.
 
 53
 00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,518
 No, there's not—There's nothing.
 
 54
 00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,073
 Breathe into his mouth.
 
 55
 00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,475
 No, they don't teach that anymore.
 It doesn't work.
 
 56
 00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,195
 You, come here.
 Breathe into his mouth.
 
 57
 00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,672
 No.
 
 58
 00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,594
 Get rid of him.
 
 59
 00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,836
 Look, Tuco,
 we can't do him like that, man.
 
 60
 00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,758
 Buzzards and rats and all that.
 
 61
 00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,475
 I'm just saying, you know?
 It's not very Christian.
 
 62
 00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,479
 That sounds like arguing.
 
 63
 00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,236
 Gonzo, hurry up.
 
 64
 00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,115
 What's the big hurry?
 
 65
 00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,393
 Oh, I.... I just think we're done here.
 
 66
 00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,397
 Oh, yeah?
 
 67
 00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,391
 You're done.
 
 68
 00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,674
 Hey, I'm back here.
 
 69
 00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,397
 Hello?
 
 70
 00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,195
 ''Are already married--''
 
 
 71
 00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,753
 Hello?
 
 72
 00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,591
 ''Thank you to our viewers--''
 
 
 73
 00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,631
 Hey.
 
 74
 00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,516
 ''The crash happened''
 
 ''as rush hour began around 8 a.m.''
 
 
 75
 00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,273
 Walt?
 
 76
 00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,429
 Didn't you hear me?
 
 77
 00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,349
 Walt.
 
 78
 00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,398
 Walt.
 
 79
 00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,629
 -Hey.
 -Hey yourself.
 
 80
 00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,990
 What, you can't answer
 when I'm calling you?
 
 81
 00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,597
 Are you okay?
 
 82
 00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,872
 Great.
 
 83
 00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,195
 New hat?
 
 84
 00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,033
 Yeah.
 
 85
 00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,872
 I got some chicken at Albertson's.
 
 86
 00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,832
 Do you want me to heat
 some up for you?
 
 87
 00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,749
 ''But they can occasionally adapt''
 
 ''to other local areas...''
 
 
 88
 00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,316
 ''...like airports, golf courses--''
 
 
 89
 00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,836
 Where've you been?
 
 90
 00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,438
 What is...?
 
 91
 00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,309
 What are you doing?
 
 92
 00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,478
 Okay.
 
 93
 00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,670
 You know what?
 I've got all this crap on my face.
 
 94
 00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,791
 Let me clean up first, okay?
 
 95
 00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,834
 You know, Walter Junior's
 gonna be home any minute, so....
 
 96
 00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,838
 Okay. Yeah, just....
 
 97
 00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,395
 Okay. Enough.
 
 98
 00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,556
 Hold up. Stop it.
 
 99
 00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,795
 Stop it!
 
 100
 00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,349
 I know you're scared...
 
 101
 00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,637
 ...and you're angry and frustrated.
 And I know none of this is fair.
 
 102
 00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,430
 But you cannot take it out on me.
 
 103
 00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,949
 Hey, I'm home.
 
 104
 00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,275
 Oh, we are dead.
 
 105
 00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,835
 Dead, man.
 
 106
 00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,508
 ''Ruto''
  or ''rute''
 or however the hell you—107
 00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,472
 -This is conjecture.
 -This is conjecture?
 
 108
 00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,511
 -Conjecture isn't helping.
 -Conjecture--?
 
 109
 00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,917
 -We need to state the facts.
 -Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:
 
 110
 00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,112
 My phone rang eight times last night.
 Dead air, hang ups every time.
 
 111
 00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,992
 Second fact:
 Like 3 in the morning...
 
 112
 00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,430
 ...I saw that Caddy of his
 cruising my neighbourhood.
 
 113
 00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,995
 If he wanted to kill us,
 he would've at the junkyard.
 
 114
 00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,634
 What is that, conjecture?
 
 115
 00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,310
 Are you basing that on that he's got
 a normal, healthy brain or something?
 
 116
 00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,752
 Did you not see him beat a dude
 to death for, like, nothing?
 
 117
 00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,679
 And that way—That way he just kept staring at us...
 
 118
 00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,316
 ...saying, "You're done."
 
 119
 00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,475
 "You're done"?
 
 120
 00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,194
 You know what that means?
 I will tell you what that means.
 
 121
 00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,153
 That means
 exactly how it sounds, yo.
 
 122
 00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,828
 All right. We are witnesses.
 We are loose ends.
 
 123
 00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,156
 Right now, Tuco's thinking,
 "Yeah, hey...
 
 124
 00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,638
 ...they cook good meth,
 but can I trust them?"
 
 125
 00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,872
 What happens
 when he decides "no"?
 
 126
 00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,509
 No.
 
 127
 00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,359
 It is him or us. You understand?
 It is him or us!
 
 128
 00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,995
 -How would you do it?
 -What do you mean, how?
 
 129
 00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,556
 Specifically, how would you do it?
 Step by step.
 
 130
 00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,597
 All right.
 
 131
 00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,473
 Say we set up one last sale.
 
 132
 00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,752
 This is providing he doesn't decide
 to waste us before then.
 
 133
 00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,032
 Every time we bring in a new batch,
 he always tests the product, right?
 
 134
 00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,392
 So as his head is down,
 you know, giving it a snort, just:
 
 135
 00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,309
 So three shots?
 
 136
 00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,077
 -Three shots or, I don't know, two.
 -Wait, is it two, or is it three?
 
 137
 00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,555
 -Two would probably work, I guess.
 -Okay, two shots.
 
 138
 00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,159
 Two in the chest, in the face?
 
 139
 00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,670
 I'm just trying to understand
 how this works.
 
 140
 00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,316
 Okay.
 All right, we'll put a pin in that.
 
 141
 00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,476
 But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...
 
 142
 00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,636
 -...he's probably coming at you, right?
 -Yeah.
 
 143
 00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,910
 -You turn toward him.
 -Yeah, just wheel on him—144
 00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,872
 How many shots for him?
 He's a big guy.
 
 145
 00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,399
 How many shots does that take?
 
 146
 00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,318
 -I don't know. Three shots.
 -Three shots.
 
 147
 00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,193
 Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
 Two men down.
 
 148
 00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,913
 Now, is there anyone else there?
 
 149
 00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,112
 I mean, Tuco is usually
 with someone else, right?
 
 150
 00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,757
 Maybe even a couple of guys.
 His dealers, his posse.
 
 151
 00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,192
 All right.
 
 152
 00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,550
 So we'll put a pin in that one too.
 
 153
 00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,637
 At this point, how many shots fired?
 
 154
 00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,718
 You've gotta be running low.
 How many bullets does that gun take?
 
 155
 00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,397
 It's not—156
 00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,433
 How can you suggest
 that we kill a man...
 
 157
 00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,154
 ...and you can't even open the gun?
 
 158
 00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,357
 -It's not that easy, is it?
 -Hey, man, Walt, you did it.
 
 159
 00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,031
 Yeah.
 
 160
 00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,311
 Call Skyler.
 
 161
 00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,678
 ''Hey, there. You've reached Walt,''
 
 ''Skyler and Walter, Jr.''
 
 
 162
 00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,236
 ''We can't come to the phone right now,''
 
 ''so please leave us a message.''
 
 
 163
 00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,715
 Well, aren't you early bird,
 up and out already?
 
 164
 00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,388
 The big lug and I are gonna go try
 that new restaurant...
 
 165
 00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,999
 ...over by UNM tonight...
 
 166
 00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,589
 ...so let me know
 if you guys wanna hang.
 
 167
 00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,791
 Listen to me. "Hang."
 
 168
 00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,151
 Walt Jr. will be proud.
 I know the lingo.
 
 169
 00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,873
 I'm still hip.
 
 170
 00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,028
 It's Chinese. The restaurant.
 
 171
 00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,993
 I don't know,
 I just feel like Chinese.
 
 172
 00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,149
 Do you think that people in China
 ever just feel like American?
 
 173
 00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,150
 You know, and they go out
 and get little takeout boxes...
 
 174
 00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,920
 ...with mashed potatoes
 and meat loaf...
 
 175
 00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,636
 ...and try and figure out how
 to use the little knives and forks?
 
 176
 00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,229
 I wonder if that ever happens.
 
 177
 00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,830
 All right, I'll let you go. So call me.
 
 178
 00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,196
 Skyler didn't pick up?
 
 179
 00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,468
 Obviously she's not home.
 
 180
 00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,155
 Baby. Baby, wait up.
 
 181
 00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,555
 Hey, what was that about Chinese?
 
 182
 00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,637
 Dinner tonight. That new place.
 
 183
 00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,469
 -How late they serve?
 -I don't know.
 
 184
 00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,477
 You got Dave at 8.
 
 185
 00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,520
 -Not tonight.
 -Yeah, you do. Remember?
 
 186
 00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,233
 No, that's Thursday.
 
 187
 00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,716
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure
 that's Thursday.
 
 188
 00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,115
 Remember how at the last minute
 they changed it?
 
 189
 00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,834
 They were gonna charge us
 a penalty.
 
 190
 00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,031
 Look, baby,
 you only got six more sessions.
 
 191
 00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,309
 And I'm doing them, Hank.
 
 192
 00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,318
 I said I would do them,
 and I'm doing them.
 
 193
 00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,592
 I can't help it if you got
 your days of the week wrong.
 
 194
 00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,870
 Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.
 
 195
 00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,997
 Look, it's.... You know, it's just....
 
 196
 00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,792
 Oh, boy. I....
 
 197
 00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,028
 I think Dave is really helping you.
 
 198
 00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,478
 Yeah.
 
 199
 00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,309
 Yeah.
 
 200
 00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,989
 Sorry about that.
 
 201
 00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,431
 She's....
 
 202
 00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,036
 Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?
 
 203
 00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,558
 Hits two in the sand,
 two in the forest...
 
 204
 00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,194
 -...and then he says, "Give me a four."
 -Hey, Gomez.
 
 205
 00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,834
 Gomez? What do you got for me?
 
 206
 00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,951
 Come on. Chop-chop.
 
 207
 00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,469
 Good morning to you too.
 
 208
 00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,031
 A.P.D. sent this over.
 This was about eight or 10 days ago.
 
 209
 00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,073
 -You know Southwest Aniline, right?
 -Yeah, off the 25?
 
 210
 00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,429
 The place smells like feet.
 
 211
 00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,790
 This is them. Check this out.
 
 212
 00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,391
 -Holy shit. What was that?
 -Thermite. So they tell me.
 
 213
 00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,272
 Burns about 5000 degrees.
 
 214
 00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,391
 Kind of stuff you see
 on a James Bond movie.
 
 215
 00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,115
 Nice. Guys who know their trade.
 
 216
 00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,157
 Wait. I take that back.
 
 217
 00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,989
 What, they didn't think
 about stealing a hand truck?
 
 218
 00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,795
 Hey, try rolling it, morons.
 It's a barrel.
 
 219
 00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,718
 It rolls. Jesus.
 
 220
 00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,668
 -So, what'd they get?
 -Methylamine, 30 gallons.
 
 221
 00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,911
 P2P?
 
 222
 00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,873
 They're cooking
 old school biker meth.
 
 223
 00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,668
 Who the hell still does that?
 
 224
 00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,553
 All the old-timers I know
 are either dead or in prison.
 
 225
 00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,192
 Pseudo's in short supply...
 
 226
 00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,790
 ...so these two make do
 by changing up the formula.
 
 227
 00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,468
 That and the thermite...
 
 228
 00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,750
 ...I'd say these two
 know their chemistry.
 
 229
 00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,520
 -But ranking them as burglars?
 -Shit.
 
 230
 00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,439
 I wouldn't trust these two
 to break into the Special Olympics.
 
 231
 00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,757
 They got book learning
 but no street skills.
 
 232
 00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,279
 Maybe they're college kids.
 
 233
 00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,232
 Chem students
 trying to make a big score.
 
 234
 00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,556
 Yeah, maybe.
 
 235
 00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,228
 I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor....
 
 236
 00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,398
 That big a score, they're gonna
 wind up stepping on some toes.
 
 237
 00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,912
 Tell you what, they better pray
 it's us who catches up to them...
 
 238
 00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,759
 ...and not those boys from Juárez.
 
 239
 00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,513
 Your daughter wants out.
 
 240
 00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,918
 ''Hey there. You've reached Walt,''
 
 ''Skyler and Walter Jr.''
 
 
 241
 00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,634
 ''We can't come to the phone,''
 
 ''so please leave us a message.''
 
 
 242
 00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,995
 ''Hey, it's me.''
 
 
 243
 00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,633
 ''Thought I'd try you earlier...''
 
 
 244
 00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,310
 ''...before you go out''
 
 ''and, you know, face the day.''
 
 
 245
 00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,714
 ''I'm realising now...''
 
 
 246
 00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,798
 ''...it probably takes you a little longer''
 
 ''to get to the phone...''
 
 
 247
 00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,151
 ''...owing to the extra baby weight--''
 
 
 248
 00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,633
 Hey, sweetie.
 
 249
 00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,794
 Walt, did you spend
 the entire night out here?
 
 250
 00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,438
 No.
 
 251
 00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,711
 No, no. Well, not all of it.
 
 252
 00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,396
 Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of—My stomach, you know.
 
 253
 00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,434
 I knew I was gonna be up and down,
 so I just didn't wanna wake you.
 
 254
 00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
 -How would he know where I live?
 -You sure it was Tuco?
 
 255
 00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,915
 Who else could it be?
 
 256
 00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,076
 -Did you ever tell him my name?
 -No.
 
 257
 00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,157
 Did you tell him
 where I live or anything?
 
 258
 00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,157
 -No.
 -What about Gonzo, or the dead one?
 
 259
 00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,430
 -Did you tell them anything?
 -I didn't say jack.
 
 260
 00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,030
 Okay, Tuco must've put out,
 like, you know, feelers.
 
 261
 00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,199
 He's got his ways and means, yo.
 Sources, all right? He's closing in.
 
 262
 00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,350
 And what happens when he finds out
 that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?
 
 263
 00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,437
 Oh, God. What happens then?
 
 264
 00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,436
 Look, it's got five bullets.
 
 265
 00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,872
 I finally figured out how to....
 Look, I just finally—I figured it out.
 
 266
 00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,548
 I say we get a second gun, right?
 For you.
 
 267
 00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,514
 I mean, don't we, like,
 double our chances?
 
 268
 00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,392
 I mean, mathematically.
 
 269
 00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,629
 I've got a better idea.
 
 270
 00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,596
 Thank God.
 
 271
 00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,119
 All right.
 
 272
 00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,550
 What is it, Mr. White?
 Lay it on me.
 
 273
 00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,678
 -Beans.
 -Beans?
 
 274
 00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,073
 They're castor beans.
 
 275
 00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,838
 So, what are we gonna do
 with them?
 
 276
 00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,389
 Are we just gonna grow
 a magic beanstalk?
 
 277
 00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,113
 Climb it and escape?
 
 278
 00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,629
 We are going to process them
 into ricin.
 
 279
 00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,359
 Rice and beans?
 
 280
 00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,313
 Ricin.
 It's an extremely effective poison.
 
 281
 00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,711
 It's toxic in small doses.
 
 282
 00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,275
 Also fairly easy to overlook
 during an autopsy.
 
 283
 00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,156
 All right.
 
 284
 00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,033
 -All right. So--
 -Don't touch them.
 
 285
 00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,192
 -You can get poisoned from beans?
 -Yes.
 
 286
 00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,712
 Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
 to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.
 
 287
 00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,396
 The KGB modified
 the tip of an umbrella...
 
 288
 00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,591
 ...to inject a tiny pellet
 into the man's leg.
 
 289
 00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,076
 And we're talking about an amount
 not bigger than the head of a pin.
 
 290
 00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,509
 But it—It killed him?
 
 291
 00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,551
 Oh, yes.
 
 292
 00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
 Now we just need to figure out
 a delivery device...
 
 293
 00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,995
 ...and then no more Tuco.
 
 294
 00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,831
 -Hey, Sky.
 -Hey, Hank.
 
 295
 00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,992
 How you doing?
 
 296
 00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,033
 Is this.... This a bad time?
 
 297
 00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,550
 No, come on in.
 
 298
 00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,875
 I should've called first. I'm sorry.
 
 299
 00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,631
 What can I do for you?
 
 300
 00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,511
 Maybe we ought—301
 00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,597
 You wanna sit down first?
 
 302
 00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,275
 I don't know, Hank.
 
 303
 00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,517
 Depends on whether or not
 this is gonna be about Marie.
 
 304
 00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,429
 -Did she send you?
 -Hell, no.
 
 305
 00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,108
 She's barely even talking to me.
 
 306
 00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,072
 That's why I'm here, okay?
 
 307
 00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,193
 Self-preservation. Big time.
 
 308
 00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,918
 Look...
 
 309
 00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,596
 ...I know you gals have
 your ups and downs.
 
 310
 00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,199
 -I get it.
 -Gals.
 
 311
 00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,551
 And I need to get involved
 like I need a second hole in my ass.
 
 312
 00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,555
 But if you could do me this huge favour
 and just return her phone calls.
 
 313
 00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,318
 I don't think
 I'm quite ready to do that yet.
 
 314
 00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,229
 Communication. Communication,
 right? Back and forth. Come on.
 
 315
 00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,716
 Sky, do this for me, please.
 You can yell at her.
 
 316
 00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,115
 Just call her back.
 
 317
 00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,756
 Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.
 
 318
 00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,919
 That's right.
 
 319
 00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,877
 That baby tiara
 she gave me at the shower?
 
 320
 00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,197
 She stole it
 from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.
 
 321
 00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,597
 I almost got arrested
 when I went back to return it.
 
 322
 00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,078
 And Marie won't admit it.
 She won't apologise.
 
 323
 00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,069
 Yeah.
 
 324
 00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,479
 If I thought you were gonna return it,
 I would have never, you know....
 
 325
 00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,515
 You knew about this.
 
 326
 00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,909
 We're working on it.
 
 327
 00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,078
 I mean,
 she's got this therapist, Dave.
 
 328
 00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,078
 -And I mean, Dave is really good.
 -Dave's good, yeah.
 
 329
 00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,794
 But it's an ongoing process, Sky...
 
 330
 00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,515
 ...and we have gotta be
 understanding, you know?
 
 331
 00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,119
 I mean, we gotta, you know.
 
 332
 00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,835
 We gotta support the shit out of her.
 
 333
 00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,709
 Do we?
 
 334
 00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,239
 Yeah.
 
 335
 00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,273
 I need support.
 
 336
 00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,153
 Me.
 
 337
 00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,271
 The almost-40-year-old
 pregnant woman...
 
 338
 00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,198
 ...with the surprise baby on the way.
 
 339
 00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,478
 And the husband
 with the lung cancer...
 
 340
 00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,319
 ...who disappears for hours,
 and I don't know where he goes.
 
 341
 00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,397
 And he barely
 even speaks to me anymore.
 
 342
 00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,474
 With the moody son
 who does the same thing.
 
 343
 00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,352
 And the overdrawn
 checking account.
 
 344
 00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,950
 And the lukewarm water heater
 that leaks rusty-looking crap...
 
 345
 00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,754
 ...and is rotting out the floor
 of the utility closet...
 
 346
 00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,996
 ...and we can't even afford to fix it.
 
 347
 00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,033
 But, oh, I see.
 
 348
 00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,754
 Now I'm supposed to go,
 "Hank, please...
 
 349
 00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,349
 ...what can I possibly do
 to further benefit...
 
 350
 00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,199
 ...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
 bitch sister...
 
 351
 00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,198
 ...who somehow always manages
 to be the centre of attention?"
 
 352
 00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,111
 Because God knows she's the one
 with the really important problems.
 
 353
 00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,918
 Want me to take a look
 at that utility closet?
 
 354
 00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,592
 That's all it takes?
 
 355
 00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,195
 That's all it takes.
 
 356
 00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,753
 So now what?
 
 357
 00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,960
 Now we arrange our next meet.
 
 358
 00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,390
 In a public place this time.
 Nice and safe.
 
 359
 00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,556
 Business as usual.
 
 360
 00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,275
 And after we sell him our usual
 four pounds, then we'll pull this out.
 
 361
 00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,509
 "By the way, Tuco, this is a new
 formula we've been working on.
 
 362
 00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,789
 Care to try it?"
 
 363
 00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,672
 Okay, well, what's new about it?
 
 364
 00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,910
 I mean, just in case he asks.
 What do we say?
 
 365
 00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,599
 I don't know.
 Whatever you want.
 
 366
 00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,153
 It gets the user insanely high.
 
 367
 00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,669
 I mean, how much salesmanship
 do we really need?
 
 368
 00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,190
 That degenerate snorts anything
 he gets his hands on.
 
 369
 00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,437
 Okay, well, we'll just put
 a pin in that, then.
 
 370
 00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,559
 Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
 maybe 72...
 
 371
 00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,228
 ...it'll look like natural causes.
 
 372
 00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,319
 -What, like a heart attack?
 -Yeah.
 
 373
 00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,351
 Or the flu, maybe.
 
 374
 00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,279
 His associates won't know
 any differently...
 
 375
 00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,230
 ...and we'll be in the clear.
 
 376
 00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,273
 Not if Tuco kills us first.
 
 377
 00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,876
 Just keep it down.
 
 378
 00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,116
 Hey, Hank. What's up?
 
 379
 00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,833
 ''Oh, hey, buddy.''
 
 
 380
 00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,629
 You been home yet?
 
 381
 00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,350
 No. Why?
 
 382
 00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,834
 ''Well....''
 
 
 383
 00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,279
 Because I really screwed up.
 
 384
 00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,438
 ''I apologise in advance for the earful''
 
 ''you're gonna hear from Skyler.''
 
 
 385
 00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,279
 ''I was trying to get her and Marie''
 
 ''talking again. Big mistake.''
 
 
 386
 00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,508
 -I should have just kept out of it.
 ''-Yeah, well, okay.''
 
 
 387
 00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,233
 Me and my big mouth, I guess.
 
 388
 00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,955
 Yeah, well, that—You know, it happens.
 It's no problem. No worries.
 
 389
 00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,628
 ''Yeah, well, thanks, man.''
 
 ''I appreciate that.''
 
 
 390
 00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,629
 Jesus, the wives, huh?
 
 391
 00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,115
 Hank, unfortunately, I really—392
 00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,676
 ''Oh, yeah.''
 
 ''Hey, man, don't let me keep you.''
 
 
 393
 00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,510
 Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.
 
 394
 00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,358
 You wanna see something
 really freaky?
 
 395
 00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,711
 -Well, I would, but--
 ''-Seriously, Walt, this is....''
 
 
 396
 00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,839
 You gotta check out this crime scene
 me and Gomie are at. Just a second.
 
 397
 00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,955
 ''Hank.''
 
 
 398
 00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,196
 Hang on. It should be
 coming through right now.
 
 399
 00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,428
 Guess it could be worse, huh?
 Could be having a day like these two.
 
 400
 00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,951
 ''Couple of local bulletheads.''
 
 
 401
 00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,993
 Guess they pissed off
 the wrong guy.
 
 402
 00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,397
 ''Walt, you there?''
 
 
 403
 00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,073
 ''Hey, Walt?''
 
 
 404
 00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,600
 -I'm taking this.
 -No. It's my gun. I need it!
 
 405
 00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,268
 No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
 Get out of here.
 
 406
 00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,472
 Tuco killing Gonzo means
 he's coming after us next. I've....
 
 407
 00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,911
 I've gotta get home. My family.
 
 408
 00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,311
 Skyler?
 
 409
 00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,030
 Walter, Jr.?
 
 410
 00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,031
 Skyler?
 
 411
 00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,998
 Hey.
 
 412
 00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,038
 Where's Walter, Jr.?
 
 413
 00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,755
 Having dinner at Louis' house.
 Supposedly.
 
 414
 00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,118
 Yep. All day, I've had
 the whole house to myself.
 
 415
 00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,113
 So where have you been
 this time?
 
 416
 00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,116
 Walt?
 
 417
 00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,637
 Walt?
 
 418
 00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,233
 Walt, will you come in here
 and talk to me please?
 
 419
 00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,077
 Walt!
 
 420
 00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,555
 I'll be right there.
 
 421
 00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,390
 Yeah, I recognise
 these two knobjobs.
 
 422
 00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,909
 Known associates
 of a psychotic piece of shit...
 
 423
 00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,314
 ...named Tuco Salamanca.
 
 424
 00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,954
 -Guess he got tired of associating.
 -Yeah.
 
 425
 00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,674
 -Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
 -No, go ahead.
 
 426
 00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,030
 Thanks.
 
 427
 00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,469
 The big one smells fresher.
 
 428
 00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,554
 You guys find a death wound?
 
 429
 00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,071
 I see lots of blood,
 but no bullet holes.
 
 430
 00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,873
 Yeah. You done taking pictures?
 
 431
 00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,553
 All right. Let's lay them out flat.
 
 432
 00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,795
 Let me get out of your way here,
 man.
 
 433
 00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,999
 Snap.
 
 434
 00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,919
 Damn, Ricky.
 Leave something for the coroner.
 
 435
 00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,476
 Oh, this is beautiful.
 
 436
 00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,351
 Hey, someone call Jay Leno.
 
 437
 00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,198
 We got the world's
 dumbest criminal.
 
 438
 00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,709
 This guy wasn't murdered. Look.
 
 439
 00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,708
 Big stuff here
 was moving this guy's body...
 
 440
 00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,117
 ...when the stack must have shifted.
 
 441
 00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,552
 Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
 and he bled out.
 
 442
 00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,151
 -Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
 -Don't you just?
 
 443
 00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,396
 Get a photo of me
 with this guy, all right?
 
 444
 00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,717
 Old stumpy, here.
 Make sure you get the stump in there.
 
 445
 00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,352
 Walt, would you talk to me, please?
 
 446
 00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,234
 I don't know where to begin.
 
 447
 00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,193
 What the hell are you doing here?
 
 448
 00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,069
 Get in.
 
 449
 00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,593
 Get in.
 
 450
 00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,837
 Let's go.
