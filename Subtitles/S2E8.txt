 1
 00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,919
 Hey.
 2
 00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,033
 You....
 3
 00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,272
 You selling?
 4
 00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,952
 I don't know
 what you're talking about.
 5
 00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,276
 Okay. That's cool.
 6
 00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,514
 I'm just saying, you know,
 if you were selling...
 7
 00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,115
 ...I could maybe do with a teenth.
 8
 00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,512
 You're kidding, right?
 9
 00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,710
 Dude, I sell bacon.
 10
 00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,115
 What? What are you talking about?
 11
 00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,912
 Oh, gee, I don't know.
 12
 00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,839
 How about over there.
 That brown van.
 13
 00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,115
 That's yours, right?
 14
 00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,151
 What brown van?
 15
 00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,436
 Parked all inconspicuous.
 16
 00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,631
 It's a cop van.
 17
 00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,760
 Yeah, another one right over there.
 18
 00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,074
 "Duke City Flowers" Come on.
 19
 00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,236
 Can't you at least be original?
 20
 00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,749
 Dude, I just wanna get high.
 21
 00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,076
 A flower van.
 22
 00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,274
 You know what you should do
 is a garbage truck.
 23
 00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,357
 Seriously, and I don't mean
 to disrespect...
 24
 00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,028
 ...but if you put cops
 in the back of a garbage truck...
 25
 00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,231
 ...there's no way
 I'm seriously thinking...
 26
 00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,591
 ...that there's cops
 in the back of a garbage truck.
 27
 00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,310
 It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.
 28
 00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,590
 Think about it, boys.
 29
 00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,473
 All right. I'm hitting it.
 30
 00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,038
 You dudes give up that easy?
 31
 00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,151
 I'm not a cop.
 32
 00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,156
 Then lift your shirt.
 Show me you're not wearing a wire.
 33
 00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,279
 All right, you know what?
 34
 00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,153
 Just to show you
 you're being an asshole.
 35
 00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,351
 I'm blinded by white!
 36
 00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,515
 Douchebag.
 37
 00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,109
 Come on. I was joking. Come on.
 38
 00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,551
 Don't walk away angry.
 Sit down. Come on.
 39
 00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,918
 I mean, what are you
 complaining about?
 40
 00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,270
 You got abs, man. Kind of.
 41
 00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,277
 Whatever, dude.
 42
 00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,118
 I'm not even sure
 I wanna buy anymore.
 43
 00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
 I think you turned me off
 to the whole thing.
 44
 00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,036
 Come on. Don't be like that.
 45
 00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,312
 I just need you to prove it,
 you know?
 46
 00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,953
 Prove you're not a cop.
 47
 00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,754
 How the hell
 am I supposed to do that?
 48
 00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,192
 I don't know.
 49
 00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,591
 Hey, I got it. Go over there
 and punch that dude right in the face.
 50
 00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,472
 Which dude?
 51
 00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,874
 -That dude?
 -Yeah.
 52
 00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,435
 No way. He'd kick my ass.
 53
 00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,839
 True that.
 54
 00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,277
 -This is so hard, you know?
 -Yeah.
 55
 00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,439
 I know.
 56
 00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,398
 It's simple.
 57
 00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,872
 If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
 he's, like, obligated to tell you.
 58
 00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,877
 It's in the Constitution.
 59
 00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,116
 Constitution of America?
 60
 00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,874
 So go ahead and ask.
 61
 00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,275
 -You a cop?
 -No, no. Not like that.
 62
 00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,516
 Ask it, like, official.
 63
 00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,188
 Are you a police officer?
 64
 00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,110
 No, I am not a police officer.
 65
 00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,232
 Okay, then. Hundred
 and seventy-five for a teenth.
 66
 00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,117
 The price is the price, yo.
 67
 00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,992
 All right.
 68
 00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,193
 There you go. Enjoy.
 69
 00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,718
 Thanks, man.
 70
 00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,433
 Albuquerque Police!
 You're under arrest! Get on the ground!
 71
 00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,918
 Get on your stomach now!
 On your stomach! Get on the ground!
 72
 00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,872
 Hold it right there. Don't move.
 Stay down.
 73
 00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,916
 ''I had a good job''
  ''until my boss accused me of stealing.''
 
 74
 00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,957
 ''I'd better call Saul!''
 
 75
 00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,231
 ''I was out partying,''
  ''minding my own business....''
 
 76
 00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,956
 -''You are under arrest.''
 -''I'd better call Saul!''
 
 77
 00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,875
 ''Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.''
 
 78
 00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,718
 ''Did you know that you have rights?''
 
 79
 00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,275
 ''The Constitution says you do.''
  ''And so do I.''
 
 80
 00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,357
 ''I believe that until proven guilty...''
 
 81
 00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,597
 ''...every man, woman,''
  ''and child in this country is innocent.''
 
 82
 00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,677
 ''And that's why I fight for you,''
  ''Albuquerque.''
 
 83
 00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,835
 ''Better call Saul.''
 
 84
 00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,031
 ''Saul Goodman, attorney at law,''
  ''505-164-CALL.''
 
 85
 00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,118
 ''That's 505-164-CALL.''
 
 86
 00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,275
 I really need to get some furniture.
 87
 00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,959
 I suggest you start with a bed.
 88
 00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,674
 God, I wish we could smoke in here.
 89
 00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,077
 -Well, you can't.
 -Yeah, no. I know.
 90
 00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,191
 I'm just saying.
 91
 00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,272
 Don't think I can't smell that weed.
 92
 00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,277
 You better seriously hope
 that airs out.
 93
 00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,119
 My dad will keep
 your security deposit.
 94
 00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,431
 He has a nose
 like a damn bloodhound.
 95
 00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,198
 Yeah?
 96
 00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,439
 Has he ever caught you?
 97
 00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,069
 Yeah. Many times.
 98
 00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,832
 Well, listen.
 99
 00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,711
 Since I already lost my deposit
 and all...
 100
 00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,388
 ...maybe we should light up.
 101
 00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,752
 No, thanks.
 102
 00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,915
 You sure?
 103
 00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,709
 Well, is it cool if I burn one?
 104
 00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,070
 Maybe you'll change your mind.
 105
 00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,117
 Do what you wanna do, I guess.
 106
 00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,115
 Hey. What'd I say?
 107
 00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,073
 Nothing.
 108
 00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,117
 I just have to go is all.
 109
 00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,755
 What's this?
 110
 00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,793
 My 18-month chip.
 111
 00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,355
 I'm in recovery.
 112
 00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,953
 And, you know,
 pot is like stepping stones.
 113
 00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,233
 Recovery? That's cool.
 114
 00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,714
 Right on.
 115
 00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,993
 I respect that.
 116
 00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,919
 You know,
 I don't really burn much anymore.
 117
 00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,918
 It's just a sometime thing.
 118
 00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,952
 But no more, like, in the house.
 119
 00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,477
 So you wanna go grab
 some dinner?
 120
 00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,069
 I could really go for some Chinese.
 121
 00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,679
 No, I better hit it.
 122
 00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,952
 We....
 123
 00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,793
 We cool?
 124
 00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,713
 Your satellite is on, by the way.
 125
 00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,156
 That screen is badass.
 126
 00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,871
 I just think it's asking a lot.
 127
 00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,991
 He knows it.
 128
 00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,792
 He's done nothing but apologise.
 129
 00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,799
 Is this gonna be
 every weekend now?
 130
 00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,151
 No. It's just the end of the quarter.
 You remember how that was.
 131
 00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,751
 But I am earning double time,
 so there's a bright side.
 132
 00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,235
 So when the laziest boy
 in the world wakes up...
 133
 00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,317
 ...tell him he better wash
 those sneakers.
 134
 00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,475
 And I said bye.
 135
 00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,910
 And tell him
 to let them air-dry this time.
 136
 00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,759
 I don't want him
 banging the hell out of my dryer.
 137
 00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,515
 What?
 138
 00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,196
 What, you don't even get
 casual Saturday?
 139
 00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,435
 I mean....
 140
 00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,232
 No, it's just you....
 141
 00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,271
 You look nice is all.
 142
 00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,596
 It's work, Walt.
 And everybody is gonna be there.
 143
 00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,675
 -Okay.
 -Okay.
 144
 00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,235
 Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?
 145
 00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,793
 Okay.
 146
 00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,435
 -Bye.
 -Bye.
 147
 00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,272
 ''Hi. You've reached Walt,''
  ''Skyler and Walter, Jr.''
 
 148
 00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,710
 ''Please leave a message,''
  ''and we'll get back to you.''
 
 149
 00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,232
 ''Skyler? Are you there?''
  ''I don't know what to do.''
 
 150
 00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,876
 ''I.... I need to talk to you. I....''
 
 151
 00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,470
 Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?
 152
 00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,440
 Yesterday I got home
 and found him.
 153
 00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,469
 He didn't even tell me
 he was coming.
 154
 00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,236
 -A man was killed?
 -A Federale, right in front of him.
 155
 00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,351
 Three agents wounded,
 one lost his leg.
 156
 00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,030
 It's like what you hear about
 from Iraq or something.
 157
 00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,913
 -The IEDs.
 -Oh, Jesus.
 158
 00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,839
 I had to hear about it
 from Steve Gomez.
 159
 00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,349
 Hank talked to his ASAC
 for about an hour.
 160
 00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,677
 Hank could win an Oscar.
 He's so damn breezy with the man.
 161
 00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,792
 He hangs up the phone,
 goes right back to bed.
 162
 00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,597
 And all he keeps saying is,
 "I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."
 163
 00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,352
 Baby, not now.
 164
 00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,398
 It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.
 165
 00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,957
 Hey, buddy. What's...?
 166
 00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,639
 What's up?
 167
 00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,399
 I just....
 168
 00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,876
 Do you mind if I...?
 169
 00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,991
 No. No.
 170
 00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,718
 So....
 171
 00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,989
 How you doing?
 172
 00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
 Oh, you know, lousy.
 173
 00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,113
 Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.
 174
 00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,440
 I mean, everything's going through me
 like crap through a tinhorn.
 175
 00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,318
 Better not get too close.
 176
 00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,353
 Well, I'll take my chances.
 177
 00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,875
 I guess you heard about
 what happened down in Juárez?
 178
 00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,112
 Terrible.
 179
 00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,309
 What do you expect?
 Bunch of freaking animals.
 180
 00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,078
 It's like ''Apocalypse Now''
 down there.
 181
 00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,955
 It's like Colonel Kurtz
 holed up in his jungle.
 182
 00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,876
 And my SAC in El Paso
 sends me home.
 183
 00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,269
 Now, that's a sound leadership
 decision right there, huh?
 184
 00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,438
 You know, you don't put
 your second most senior man...
 185
 00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,631
 ...on the trail
 of those motherless bastards...
 186
 00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,229
 ...you send him home. You know?
 187
 00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,234
 I was, you know--
 "He's out getting an evidence bag...
 188
 00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,271
 ...and so ends up
 without a scratch on him.
 189
 00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,836
 So must be something wrong
 with that picture, you know."
 190
 00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,113
 So are you home for good then?
 191
 00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,471
 No, no. It's....
 192
 00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,389
 Playing it by ear. To be determined.
 193
 00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,469
 Think you might wanna talk it through
 with somebody?
 194
 00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,592
 What, a shrink?
 No, no, no. Can't go down that road.
 195
 00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,394
 Start going down that road,
 kiss your career goodbye.
 196
 00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,991
 Or Marie. Or me, if you like.
 197
 00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,959
 You know, I don't know
 how to say this. I....
 198
 00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,871
 You know, the things I deal with...
 199
 00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,157
 ...you and me don't have much of a--
 200
 00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,239
 What you might call
 "an experiential overlap."
 201
 00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,469
 What if I told you we do?
 202
 00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,958
 I have spent my whole life scared.
 203
 00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,912
 Frightened of things
 that could happen...
 204
 00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,350
 ...might happen, might not happen.
 205
 00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,916
 Fifty years I spent like that.
 206
 00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,030
 Finding myself awake
 at 3 in the morning.
 207
 00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,238
 But you know what?
 208
 00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,668
 Ever since my diagnosis...
 209
 00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,151
 ...I sleep just fine.
 210
 00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,113
 Okay.
 211
 00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,874
 And I came to realise
 it's that fear that's the worst of it.
 212
 00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,150
 That's the real enemy.
 213
 00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,319
 So....
 214
 00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,833
 Get up.
 215
 00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,475
 Get out in the real world.
 216
 00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,631
 And you kick that bastard
 as hard as you can right in the teeth.
 217
 00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
 Do it again. Go on.
 218
 00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,478
 Ten thousand even, same as last time.
 It's totally accurate.
 219
 00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,996
 You and I,
 we are gonna feed this machine.
 220
 00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,670
 -I want it running 24 hours a day.
 -Right on.
 221
 00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,313
 Not yours, I take it.
 222
 00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,149
 We got 10, 20, 30...
 223
 00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,150
 ...44, five each.
 224
 00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,271
 Three pounds should be 48 each.
 225
 00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,469
 Who's short?
 226
 00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,319
 All right. Don't freak, all right?
 We didn't get ripped off.
 227
 00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,397
 But Badger hasn't kicked in
 his full amount.
 228
 00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,795
 I know he was planning on pulling
 an all-nighter...
 229
 00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,638
 ...so he's probably still in the sack.
 230
 00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,549
 Then wake him up.
 He can sleep after we're paid.
 231
 00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,115
 Why you gotta be such a hard-on?
 232
 00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,709
 You're not his pal. You're his boss.
 233
 00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,229
 This only works when
 they're scared of you, remember?
 234
 00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,390
 Jack-off.
 235
 00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,557
 It's going straight to voicemail.
 236
 00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,959
 Voicemail?
 237
 00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,037
 Just chill, okay? Count your money.
 238
 00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,274
 -Combo.
 -''Yo, what's up?''
 
 239
 00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,596
 You seen Badger?
 240
 00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,397
 Don't you cover for him, bitch.
 241
 00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,353
 I ask you a straight-up question,
 I expect a straight-up answer.
 242
 00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,914
 Well?
 243
 00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,996
 They were too scared to tell me.
 244
 00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,118
 Badger got busted.
 245
 00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,038
 He's in jail.
 246
 00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,190
 ''Honey, I'm home!''
 
 247
 00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,516
 Too slow! What's up?
 248
 00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,438
 Got more lives than a damn cat.
 249
 00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,517
 Now if I could only learn
 to lick myself.
 250
 00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,671
 What's up, guys? Good to see you.
 Good to see you. Good to see you.
 251
 00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,509
 All right. Let's all get back to work,
 for chrissake, okay?
 252
 00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,837
 In my office, man. Let's see
 what you bozos been up to lately.
 253
 00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,395
 You okay?
 254
 00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,033
 Hanging in?
 255
 00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,878
 What's it look like?
 256
 00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,279
 -What's this from A.P.D.?
 -Been checking with them to see...
 257
 00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,835
 ...if they come across
 that famous blue meth of yours.
 258
 00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,395
 Sure enough, last night.
 259
 00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,909
 Got themselves
 an honest-to-God dealer.
 260
 00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,271
 I was thinking of cruising over
 and saying hello.
 261
 00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,399
 Maybe you'd like to go with me?
 262
 00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,755
 Yeah. Well, all right.
 263
 00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,636
 You told me to my face
 you weren't a cop, man.
 264
 00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,152
 I feel manipulated.
 265
 00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,873
 I thought we were gonna hang out.
 266
 00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,513
 We are hanging out, Badger.
 267
 00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,950
 You like Badger or Brandon?
 268
 00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,038
 I like people who don't, like,
 abuse the Constitution.
 269
 00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,355
 Badger, listen.
 270
 00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,234
 Hey.
 271
 00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,870
 I'm trying to help you here, man.
 272
 00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,552
 Now, if you just tell me
 who your supplier is...
 273
 00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,558
 ...I think this can end
 very well for you.
 274
 00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,592
 What are you doing, detective, talking
 to my client without me present?
 275
 00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,789
 You sneaky Pete.
 276
 00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,354
 Which is which?
 277
 00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,869
 What, did the academy hire you
 right out of the womb?
 278
 00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,798
 You guys get younger every—279
 00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,592
 What'd you say to baby face?
 280
 00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,153
 Did you say anything stupid?
 281
 00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,271
 By "anything stupid,"
 I mean anything at all.
 282
 00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,835
 Look at you.
 Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.
 283
 00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,270
 We'll talk about it later.
 Right now, you out.
 284
 00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,597
 Ten minutes ago. Go on.
 There are laws, detective.
 285
 00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,870
 Have your kindergarten teacher
 read them to you.
 286
 00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,629
 Go grab a juice box.
 Have a nap. Go on.
 287
 00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,995
 All right.
 288
 00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,792
 Who do we have?
 289
 00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,629
 Brandon Mayhew.
 290
 00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,991
 Brandon Mayhew. All right.
 291
 00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,476
 Brandon Mayhew.
 292
 00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,073
 -Here we go. Public masturbation.
 -What?
 293
 00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,033
 I don't get it. What's the kick?
 Why don't you do it at home...
 294
 00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,710
 ...with a big flat-screen TV,
 50 channels of pay-per-view?
 295
 00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,309
 In a Starbucks. That's nice.
 296
 00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,351
 That ain't me, man. I....
 297
 00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,111
 I was the guy who was selling meth.
 Allegedly.
 298
 00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,031
 Okay. All right. I got you.
 Meth. Right.
 299
 00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,276
 Sorry, that was a little
 transpositional error.
 300
 00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,994
 Nothing a little Wite-Out
 can't take care of.
 301
 00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,998
 Yeah, and felony quantity.
 302
 00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,395
 -Just barely.
 -Yeah, just barely.
 303
 00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,512
 The cops are like butchers.
 Always got their thumbs on the scales.
 304
 00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,517
 But good luck arguing that in court.
 305
 00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,319
 Let me get down to brass tacks.
 306
 00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,158
 I'm gonna get you
 a second phone call.
 307
 00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,271
 You're gonna call
 your mommy or your daddy...
 308
 00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,755
 ...or your parish priest
 or your Boy Scout leader...
 309
 00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,952
 ...and they're gonna
 deliver me a cheque for $4650.
 310
 00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,674
 I'm gonna write that down
 on the back of my business card.
 311
 00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,314
 Four-six-five-zero. Okay?
 312
 00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,479
 And I need that in a cashier's cheque
 or a money order, doesn't matter.
 313
 00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,035
 Actually, I want it in a money order.
 314
 00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,879
 And make it out to
 "Ice Station Zebra Associates."
 315
 00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,435
 That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.
 316
 00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,596
 It's done just for tax purposes.
 317
 00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,234
 And after that,
 we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...
 318
 00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,149
 ...but definitely not American Express,
 so don't even ask. All right?
 319
 00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,349
 Any questions?
 320
 00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,077
 You're gonna get me off, right?
 321
 00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,749
 What do I look like, your high-school
 girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?
 322
 00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,477
 That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.
 323
 00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,310
 Son, I promise you this.
 324
 00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,512
 I will give you
 the best criminal defence...
 325
 00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,039
 ...that money can buy.
 326
 00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,956
 Yeah, but, Francesca,
 I took these already.
 327
 00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,798
 Didn't I take these already?
 328
 00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,833
 It's on your head. You're not
 supposed to double up on vitamin A.
 329
 00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,837
 It's bad for the liver.
 330
 00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,396
 Okay, who's next?
 331
 00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,750
 Did him. I did him.
 332
 00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,110
 That one went public defender.
 Thanks for nothing.
 333
 00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,278
 What happened to my masturbator?
 You got me all turned around.
 334
 00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,279
 Hang on. I'll get back to you.
 335
 00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,035
 I sense you're discussing my client.
 Anything you care to share with me?
 336
 00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,754
 Sure. Your commercials?
 They suck ass.
 337
 00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,954
 I've seen better acting
 in an epileptic whorehouse.
 338
 00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,832
 Is that like the one
 your mom works at?
 339
 00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,713
 Is she still offering
 the two-for-one discount?
 340
 00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,673
 DEA, huh? For a street bust.
 341
 00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,872
 Now, what would two feds
 want with that little twerp?
 342
 00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,277
 Sooner or later,
 this was gonna happen.
 343
 00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,710
 You want your exponential growth...
 344
 00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,876
 ...guys are gonna get busted.
 Simple as that.
 345
 00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,878
 How about we get him a real attorney?
 What the hell is this?
 346
 00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,672
 This is who he hires?
 347
 00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,758
 What? Are you kidding me?
 This is the guy you want.
 348
 00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,678
 This is the guy I'd hire.
 349
 00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,759
 It's the guy you'd hire.
 350
 00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,234
 Look, you remember Emilio?
 351
 00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,433
 Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
 like, twice. Okay?
 352
 00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,997
 Both times, they had him
 dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.
 353
 00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,315
 Dude is like Houdini.
 354
 00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,238
 Seriously,
 when the going gets tough...
 355
 00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,192
 ...you don't want a criminal lawyer.
 356
 00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,597
 You want a "criminal" lawyer.
 357
 00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,518
 Know what I'm saying?
 358
 00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,076
 Look, we're in good shape,
 Mr. White.
 359
 00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,430
 Badger is way too loyal to roll.
 360
 00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,517
 Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
 all right.
 361
 00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,838
 We pay four large. Cost of business.
 Take it out of his payroll.
 362
 00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,712
 And it's only his first dealing rap...
 363
 00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,388
 ...so, worst-case scenario,
 you know, they plead him out.
 364
 00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,990
 He does five months picking up litter
 in an orange jump suit.
 365
 00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,948
 So who goes inside?
 I don't need them seeing my face.
 366
 00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,594
 Well, I don't need them
 seeing my face.
 367
 00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,758
 Why not?
 You look like his typical clientele.
 368
 00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,359
 Dick.
 369
 00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,993
 Fine.
 370
 00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,074
 We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.
 371
 00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,158
 Heads.
 372
 00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,677
 Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?
 373
 00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,875
 Mr. Mayhew.
 374
 00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,913
 Nice of you to come down. Please.
 375
 00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,309
 Look at you.
 376
 00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,349
 Should I call the FBI
 and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?
 377
 00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,675
 Joking.
 378
 00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,871
 I-- Please, come on.
 379
 00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,798
 Come on. Please.
 380
 00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,718
 Hello.
 381
 00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,953
 Saul Goodman. Please sit.
 382
 00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,110
 So it's a shame that we have to meet
 under these circumstances.
 383
 00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,153
 I believe you have
 something for me?
 384
 00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,391
 Oh, yes.
 385
 00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,072
 -Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
 -Irish.
 386
 00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,999
 Faith and begorra.
 A fellow potato-eater.
 387
 00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,479
 My real name is McGill.
 388
 00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,798
 The Jew thing
 I just do for the homeboys.
 389
 00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,879
 They all want a pipe-hitting member
 of the tribe, so to speak.
 390
 00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,193
 I digress.
 Good things are happening.
 391
 00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,075
 Fact is, your nephew is gonna
 get out in no time.
 392
 00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,838
 That's wonderful, yeah.
 393
 00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,315
 There's still a few details
 to be ironed out...
 394
 00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,397
 ...but now that the DEA
 is involved...
 395
 00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,150
 ...I think he's looking
 at time served, then probation.
 396
 00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,591
 So leave your number with Francesca,
 and we'll be in touch.
 397
 00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,358
 -Excuse me, the DEA?
 -Yeah.
 398
 00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,996
 That's the Drug Enforcement
 Administration. The feds.
 399
 00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,995
 I hope that I'm not
 the breaker of bad news...
 400
 00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,590
 ...but your nephew got mixed up
 with some pretty nasty customers.
 401
 00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,755
 I understand that.
 402
 00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,598
 What does that have
 to do with the DEA?
 403
 00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,233
 They're after some mystery man...
 404
 00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,795
 ...some heavy-hitter
 that goes by the name Heisenberg.
 405
 00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,309
 They want this guy
 like the axe wants the turkey.
 406
 00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,351
 Seems young Brandon
 may have information...
 407
 00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,312
 ...that could lead to his arrest.
 408
 00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,751
 Jesus, cheer up.
 This is good news.
 409
 00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,394
 I mean, Brandon fell head-first
 into the doo-doo pile...
 410
 00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,477
 ...and came up
 smelling like Paco Rabanne.
 411
 00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,632
 Wait, wait. Look, I just.... I think....
 412
 00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,755
 I just think that we should
 review our options.
 413
 00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,313
 Options?
 414
 00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,431
 I'm gonna tell you
 what your options are.
 415
 00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,076
 You got a grand total of two.
 Option A: Brandon takes the deal.
 416
 00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,350
 Option B:
 Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...
 417
 00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,074
 ...and gets his rectum
 resized about yay big.
 418
 00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,750
 Look, look. What about reprisals?
 419
 00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,678
 I mean, if Badger—420
 00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,113
 If Brandon informs
 on this Heisenberg....
 421
 00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,192
 I mean, what if, God forbid...
 422
 00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,996
 ...that they decide to take revenge?
 423
 00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,918
 What have you been telling him?
 424
 00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,396
 The kid keeps spouting off about,
 "If I talk, they'll kill me."
 425
 00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,398
 Right now, he's the only thing
 holding up this deal.
 426
 00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,118
 -Good.
 -No, that's not good. That's terrible.
 427
 00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,278
 Trust me, sir, your nephew
 won't last in prison two weeks.
 428
 00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,040
 You let him take his chances
 on the outside.
 429
 00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,117
 Maybe I can work
 in some witness protection.
 430
 00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,835
 No, look, look.
 These are vicious, desperate people.
 431
 00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,795
 I've been told that
 one of them killed another man...
 432
 00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,310
 ...by crushing his head
 with an ATM machine.
 433
 00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,835
 People love to take credit
 for the fun ones.
 434
 00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,350
 The guy who got his head smooshed
 used to be a client of mine.
 435
 00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,028
 His wife killed him, all right?
 It was open and shut.
 436
 00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,629
 Trust me, you folks have
 nothing to worry about, okay?
 437
 00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,037
 I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
 get him singing like a canary...
 438
 00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,549
 ...all's right with the world.
 439
 00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,596
 Ten thousand dollars.
 440
 00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,393
 Ten thousand, cash to you.
 441
 00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,075
 I'm not saying to throw the case.
 442
 00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,149
 Just no talking to the DEA.
 443
 00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,355
 Are you saying
 what I think you're saying?
 444
 00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,439
 Yes.
 445
 00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,998
 What's it going to be?
 446
 00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,630
 What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?
 447
 00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,679
 That dude in there?
 Saul Goodman we're talking about?
 448
 00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,472
 Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.
 449
 00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,033
 Threatened to call the police.
 450
 00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,995
 -Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
 -Like the ''Exxon Valdez.''
 
 451
 00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,991
 So, what do we do about it?
 452
 00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,196
 Hey, Francesca,
 how about I follow you home?
 453
 00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,389
 No.
 454
 00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,192
 For safety.
 455
 00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,879
 What?
 456
 00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,433
 God, you are killing me
 with that booty.
 457
 00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,034
 Talk to me.
 Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?
 458
 00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,710
 Come on, just tell me what you want.
 Jesus!
 459
 00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,911
 Oh, no, no, no!
 460
 00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,918
 No, it wasn't me.
 It was Ignacio. He's the one.
 461
 00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,759
 Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.
 462
 00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,317
 Shut up, dude.
 463
 00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,752
 Shut up, all right?
 Just speak English.
 464
 00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,713
 Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?
 465
 00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,312
 -Who?
 -Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!
 466
 00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,954
 Oh, I thought....
 467
 00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,990
 What can I do for you gentlemen?
 468
 00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,509
 Anything.
 Just tell me what you need.
 469
 00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,633
 This afternoon, an associate of ours
 offered you $10,000.
 470
 00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,319
 You should have taken it.
 471
 00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,478
 Wait a minute.
 This is in regards to what's-his-name?
 472
 00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,989
 Badger! Brandon Mayhew.
 473
 00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,590
 The uncle. That was your guy?
 474
 00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,399
 No offence, but I don't take bribes
 from strangers, you know?
 475
 00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,830
 Better safe than sorry.
 That's my motto.
 476
 00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,272
 -But I'll take your money! Sure!
 -No, that offer has expired, yo.
 477
 00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,234
 It was kind of low anyways.
 But okay, okay, I'll take it.
 478
 00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,078
 Just tell me what you need,
 all right?
 479
 00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,271
 I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
 a happy thought...
 480
 00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,675
 ...and assume
 this is just a negotiating tactic.
 481
 00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,792
 All right, listen to me very carefully.
 482
 00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,797
 You are going to give
 Badger Mayhew...
 483
 00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,992
 ...the best legal representation ever.
 484
 00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,350
 But no deals with the DEA.
 485
 00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,075
 All right? Badger will not identify
 anyone to anybody.
 486
 00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,714
 If he does, you're dead.
 487
 00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,955
 Why don't you just kill Badger?
 488
 00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,513
 I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
 is buzzing around you...
 489
 00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,792
 ...and it bites you on the ass,
 you don't go gunning for the attorney.
 490
 00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,276
 You go grab a fly swatter.
 I mean, so to speak.
 491
 00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,717
 I mean, all due respect,
 but do I have to spell this out for you?
 492
 00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,192
 -We're not killing Badger, yo!
 -Then you got real problems, okay.
 493
 00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,311
 Because the DEA
 will come down on your boy...
 494
 00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,351
 ...like a proverbial ton of bricks.
 495
 00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,551
 I don't think
 I'm going out on a limb here...
 496
 00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,478
 ...but, hey,
 he's not gonna like prison.
 497
 00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,992
 He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
 regardless of what you do to me.
 498
 00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,588
 Mr. Mayhew?
 499
 00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,670
 I recognise your cough. Take that
 mask off, you know. Get some air.
 500
 00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,473
 Go on.
 501
 00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,918
 -God.
 -Take it easy.
 502
 00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,634
 Breathe in, breathe out.
 503
 00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,549
 All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
 Because I got bad knees.
 504
 00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,032
 That's better.
 505
 00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,196
 Okay, now listen. The three of us
 are gonna work this out.
 506
 00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,833
 Yeah? How?
 507
 00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,674
 First thing, you'll put a dollar
 in my pocket, both of you.
 508
 00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,470
 You want attorney-client privilege,
 don't you?
 509
 00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,592
 So that everything you say
 is strictly between us.
 510
 00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,552
 I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.
 511
 00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,318
 Come on, make it official.
 512
 00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,952
 Come on, do it.
 513
 00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,833
 That's it, come on. Just a dollar.
 514
 00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,395
 All right, now you, ski bum.
 Come on. Give with the dollar.
 515
 00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,029
 -Go on.
 -Be smart.
 516
 00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,639
 What?
 517
 00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,878
 -All I got is a five.
 -I'll take a five.
 518
 00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,516
 Come on, already.
 Come on. Be cool.
 519
 00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,751
 Okay, you're now both
 officially represented...
 520
 00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,473
 ...by Saul Goodman and Associates.
 521
 00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,878
 Your secrets are safe with me
 under threat of disbarment. All right?
 522
 00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,431
 Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
 talking to the Weather Underground.
 523
 00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,157
 Just do it.
 524
 00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,831
 Okay, so if a prison shanking
 is completely off the table....
 525
 00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,234
 And we're sure of that?
 526
 00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,193
 No shanking!
 527
 00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,553
 All right, all right.
 528
 00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,392
 The way I see it is
 somebody is going to prison.
 529
 00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,957
 It's just a matter of who.
 530
 00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,477
 All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...
 531
 00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,036
 ...your lawyer here,
 he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.
 532
 00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,434
 Time served, no probation.
 533
 00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,837
 It's pretty slick.
 Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
 534
 00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,995
 Don't get cocky.
 You ain't home free yet.
 535
 00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,156
 You don't give us
 the name of your supplier...
 536
 00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,432
 -...you're going nowhere.
 -The tough guy act is unnecessary.
 537
 00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,835
 This young man
 is cooperating fully.
 538
 00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,838
 Is that right?
 Yeah, you cooperating?
 539
 00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,393
 Okay, let's start with a name.
 540
 00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,751
 He just goes by Heisenberg.
 541
 00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,235
 Heisenberg, huh?
 542
 00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,959
 How old is this Heisenberg?
 543
 00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,269
 Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.
 544
 00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,516
 -Height?
 -Average, I guess.
 545
 00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,517
 Medium height, medium weight.
 546
 00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,598
 -What colour hair?
 -No hair.
 547
 00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,358
 Dude is balder than you.
 548
 00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,835
 1963, James Edward Kilkelly...
 549
 00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,429
 ...is convicted of stealing
 a vending machine.
 550
 00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,313
 1975, breaking and entering.
 551
 00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,034
 1982, grand theft auto.
 552
 00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,470
 1984, armed robbery.
 553
 00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,832
 1987, 1992. You get the idea.
 And here he is today.
 554
 00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,837
 Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.
 555
 00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,319
 City, state and federal, he's spent
 44 of the last 58 years inside.
 556
 00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,635
 Entire life behind bars.
 557
 00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
 Jimmy provides
 a very special service.
 558
 00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,199
 For a price,
 Jimmy will go to prison for you.
 559
 00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,709
 On purpose?
 The guy goes to prison on purpose?
 560
 00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,431
 He's actually
 more comfortable inside.
 561
 00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,949
 The outside world
 hasn't been too kind to him.
 562
 00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,831
 Sometime during
 the Clinton administration...
 563
 00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,999
 ...Jimmy figured out how he could
 use his talents to turn a profit.
 564
 00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,916
 -So when does all this happen?
 -It's already happening.
 565
 00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,348
 The buy is set for tomorrow.
 566
 00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
 Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
 everybody's happy...
 567
 00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,198
 ...and all it's gonna cost you
 is 80 thousand and one pound...
 568
 00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,833
 ...of your finest meth.
 569
 00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,955
 Eighty thousand dollars
 for eight years of his life, huh?
 570
 00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,276
 First of all,
 he's not gonna do eight years.
 571
 00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,198
 I'll represent him, and I guarantee...
 572
 00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,756
 ...there's gonna be some unexpected
 problems with the prosecution's case.
 573
 00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,474
 Secondly, he gets 30.
 Fifty goes to me.
 574
 00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,592
 -You get 50? For what?
 -For facilitating.
 575
 00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,360
 Who's taking a bigger risk here?
 He likes prison.
 576
 00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,471
 You did bring the cash, didn't you?
 577
 00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,638
 Look, if this option
 is too expensive...
 578
 00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,116
 ...you can still always...Badger
 in the chow line.
 579
 00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,671
 Conscience gets expensive,
 doesn't it?
 580
 00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,789
 All right. There's our boy.
 581
 00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,115
 Right on time.
 582
 00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,998
 -Go back.
 -What? All right, all right, all right.
 583
 00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,830
 So, what do you think?
 They see us?
 584
 00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,037
 No, man, I think we're good.
 585
 00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,231
 Badger looks like
 he's gonna throw up.
 586
 00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,039
 Give me those back.
 587
 00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,117
 Just give them to me.
 588
 00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,478
 Oh, no.
 589
 00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,189
 Where the hell is Jimmy?
 590
 00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,311
 Should've been here
 10 minutes ago.
 591
 00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,036
 You think Jimmy is actually for real?
 A guy who wants to be in prison?
 592
 00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,511
 There's more
 than one kind of prison.
 593
 00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,472
 What the hell
 is that supposed to mean?
 594
 00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,035
 There he is—Wait a minute.
 595
 00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,630
 -Oh, no, no, no.
 -What? What? Let me see.
 596
 00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,236
 -Who the hell is that?
 -I don't know.
 597
 00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,633
 Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.
 598
 00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,232
 Time to move?
 599
 00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,476
 Not till we see the exchange.
 600
 00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,078
 No, no. Oh, shit!
 601
 00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,238
 -What?
 -Now he shows.
 602
 00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,431
 Okay, let's do this.
 603
 00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,714
 No, no.
 604
 00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,354
 Oh, my God.
 Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!
 605
 00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,551
 We're screwed!
 606
 00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,079
 What are you doing?
 607
 00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,316
 Hey, what are you doing?
 608
 00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,037
 I don't get it. What's the holdup?
 609
 00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,548
 Where's the stuff, man?
 610
 00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,796
 -Where are we going?
 -Just shut up.
 611
 00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,589
 Get out. Go stop him.
 612
 00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,109
 The DEA is right there.
 If they see me, we're screwed.
 613
 00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,753
 Get out. I'll do something.
 614
 00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,871
 -What?
 -Just go!
 615
 00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,316
 Hank, I thought that was you.
 616
 00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,033
 Schrader, I'm blocked.
 617
 00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,879
 -Walt, not a good time.
 -How you doing? You feeling okay?
 618
 00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,035
 Schrader, I'm blocked.
 619
 00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,631
 We're working.
 You gotta get out of here.
 620
 00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,037
 -Working? Oh, like DEA working?
 -Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.
 621
 00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,196
 Is something going down?
 622
 00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,794
 Wrong guy, wrong guy.
 Other bench.
 623
 00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,389
 Walt, Walt.
 624
 00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,636
 -Walter, move your ass now.
 -Okay.
 625
 00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,558
 Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.
 626
 00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,433
 -We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
 -Should I back up?
 627
 00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,993
 -Go that way.
 -Forward is better?
 628
 00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,952
 I'll be out of the way there.
 Okay, okay.
 629
 00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,515
 I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
 630
 00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,188
 -I'll leave you alone.
 -We'll talk later. Just go.
 631
 00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,673
 Where'd he go?
 Where the hell did he go?
 632
 00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,677
 Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.
 633
 00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,915
 -Looks like it's going down.
 -Take him.
 634
 00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,478
 Freeze! Hey, right there.
 Don't move.
 635
 00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,153
 Come on, let's get him up.
 636
 00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,152
 Jesus!
 637
 00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,872
 I think they bought it.
 638
 00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,469
 ''Absolutely.''
 
 639
 00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,911
 Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.
 640
 00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,554
 Looks like we got a full pound
 of the blue stuff.
 641
 00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,311
 Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
 James Kilkelly.
 642
 00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,473
 Thank you. Thank you very much.
 It was my pleasure.
 643
 00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,394
 Hey.
 644
 00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,749
 You weren't home,
 so I let the delivery guys in.
 645
 00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,236
 -I hope that's okay.
 -Absolutely.
 646
 00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,310
 So you bought a bed.
 647
 00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,789
 Yeah.
 648
 00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,998
 What is that, a king?
 649
 00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,913
 Pillow top?
 650
 00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,394
 Oh, my God.
 You really are a chemistry teacher.
 651
 00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,593
 You mind?
 652
 00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,636
 I was terrible at chemistry.
 653
 00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,354
 I'm more of a humanities guy.
 654
 00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,028
 -How did you find me?
 -We should talk about that.
 655
 00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,392
 It should be much, much harder
 for people to track you down.
 656
 00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,158
 My Pl charged me for three hours...
 657
 00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,193
 ...so I seriously doubt
 it took him more than one.
 658
 00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,992
 So this is, what, blackmail?
 659
 00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,838
 Walter, I'm your lawyer.
 660
 00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,272
 Anything you say to me
 is totally privileged.
 661
 00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,914
 I'm not in the shakedown racket.
 662
 00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,429
 I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
 need lawyers, right?
 663
 00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,632
 Especially drug dealers.
 664
 00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,919
 So, what, you're just doing this
 out of the kindness of your heart?
 665
 00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,591
 Come on.
 Have you seen my hourly rate?
 666
 00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,717
 By the way,
 where do you keep the money?
 667
 00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,038
 Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
 buried in the side yard?
 668
 00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,073
 This kid Mayhew may be the first
 of your guys to get picked up...
 669
 00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,508
 ...but he won't be the last.
 670
 00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,110
 And if I can find you,
 how far behind can the cops be?
 671
 00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,673
 I don't understand.
 672
 00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,633
 What exactly are you
 offering to do for me?
 673
 00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,992
 What did Tom Hagen
 do for Vito Corleone?
 674
 00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,358
 I'm no Vito Corleone.
 675
 00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,199
 No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.
 676
 00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,833
 But with some sound advice...
 677
 00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,315
 ...and the proper introductions,
 who knows?
 678
 00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,397
 I'll tell you,
 you've got the right product.
 679
 00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,239
 Anything that gets the DEA's panties
 in this big a bunch...
 680
 00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,032
 ...you're on to something special.
 681
 00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,438
 And I would like to be
