 1
 00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,833
 All right, everybody. Listen up.
 
 2
 00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,397
 Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
 who were not with us this morning...
 
 3
 00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,670
 ...we raided his headquarters.
 
 4
 00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,632
 Also his last-known address.
 
 5
 00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,753
 Even the little den of iniquity
 he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.
 
 6
 00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,396
 We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
 The man himself smelled us coming.
 
 7
 00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,038
 So study the face. Study the file.
 
 8
 00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,515
 Get a big old raging hard-on...
 
 9
 00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,871
 ...at the idea
 of catching this piece of shit.
 
 10
 00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,676
 My apologies
 to the H.R. department.
 
 11
 00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,555
 Grow tumescent with anticipation.
 
 12
 00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,239
 All right.
 
 13
 00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,271
 On the hit parade, 1998.
 
 14
 00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,357
 Reputed to have whacked
 one "Dog" Paulson...
 
 15
 00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,313
 ...back when our bandidos
 were wresting the crank trade away...
 
 16
 00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,999
 ...from the SoCal biker gangs.
 
 17
 00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,476
 Also, we're pretty sure
 he knifed a Mexican national in '03.
 
 18
 00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,150
 And for my money, seeing
 how he customarily deals with rivals...
 
 19
 00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,874
 ...I'd say he is a prime suspect
 in the disappearance...
 
 20
 00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,230
 ...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.
 
 21
 00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,276
 Hats over your heart for that dirtball.
 
 22
 00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,391
 We hauled Tuco in
 for questioning on that...
 
 23
 00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,033
 ...but we couldn't make it stick.
 
 24
 00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,708
 Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
 Smug bastard.
 
 25
 00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,677
 And even worse, El Paso says he's
 got some kind of cartel connection.
 
 26
 00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
 Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
 what's going on down there.
 
 27
 00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,878
 We sure don't want it going on
 up here...
 
 28
 00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,798
 ...which brings us to the good news.
 
 29
 00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,312
 We finally got some actual,
 honest-to-God evidence.
 
 30
 00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,236
 This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
 Street name: No-Doze.
 
 31
 00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,796
 Found him tucked in the junkyard
 along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...
 
 32
 00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,558
 ...a.k.a. Gonzo.
 
 33
 00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,038
 Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
 was moving No-Doze's body—34
 00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,515
 Either hiding it there
 or pulling it out. Not sure.
 
 35
 00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,030—when he got his arm crushed
 clean off.
 
 36
 00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,152
 Anyone wanna see the photos,
 they're on my website. Hilarious.
 
 37
 00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,237
 Anyway. The upshot is...
 
 38
 00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,560
 ...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
 bloody fingerprint...
 
 39
 00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,036
 ...which belongs to Señor Tuco.
 
 40
 00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,676
 Christmas came early
 to the Schrader household.
 
 41
 00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,190
 That is, provided we find this guy.
 
 42
 00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,553
 So to all present, I ask you,
 you wanna find this guy?
 
 43
 00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,149
 -Yes.
 -Yes.
 
 44
 00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,713
 What the hell was that? Jesus.
 
 45
 00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,318
 Wanna try that again?
 
 46
 00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,592
 -Do you wanna find this guy?
 -Yes!
 
 47
 00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,234
 -Are we going to find this guy?
 -Yes!
 
 48
 00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,668
 -Louder, damn it!
 -Yes!
 
 49
 00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,711
 -Give me a "hell, yeah!"
 -Hell, yeah!
 
 50
 00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,558
 -Hell, yeah!
 -Hell, yeah!
 
 51
 00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,116
 ''Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.''
 
 
 52
 00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,959
 They ain't gonna find him.
 
 53
 00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,276
 Guy is in ''México'' by now.
 
 54
 00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,358
 Appearances, Gomey.
 It's all about appearances.
 
 55
 00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,718
 Listen, I gotta take
 some personal time.
 
 56
 00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,558
 Now, in the middle of a manhunt?
 
 57
 00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,110
 Skyler called last night.
 It's Walt. He's missing.
 
 58
 00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,312
 Just disappeared from the house,
 and no one's heard from him since.
 
 59
 00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,353
 Damn. You don't think he...?
 
 60
 00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,799
 Holler if you need me.
 
 61
 00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,753
 All right. Thanks a lot, man.
 Appreciate that.
 
 62
 00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,878
 This is the most recent photo.
 We haven't taken many lately, so....
 
 63
 00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,038
 But that's what he looks like now.
 
 64
 00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,471
 Without the hair.
 
 65
 00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,239
 Hey, it's me.
 
 66
 00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,792
 Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
 sparing us your day off.
 
 67
 00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,309
 No worries. Happy to help.
 
 68
 00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,670
 Yeah, this is helpful. Good.
 
 69
 00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,155
 -What about height and weight?
 -Five eleven...
 
 70
 00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,396
 ...most recently, about 170.
 
 71
 00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,833
 One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.
 
 72
 00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,759
 I guess he weighs a little less.
 
 73
 00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,077
 That's fine.
 That's close enough. Good.
 
 74
 00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,510
 What about
 other distinguishing features?
 
 75
 00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,915
 Tattoos or moles or scars?
 
 76
 00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,955
 -Anything that might help us.
 -Tattoos? No. Not really. No.
 
 77
 00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,879
 That's fine.
 
 78
 00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,832
 -Is that the list of medications?
 -Yes.
 
 79
 00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,429
 I wrote them all down.
 And there's no drug interactions.
 
 80
 00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,189
 None that are listed.
 I called his doctor, so, no.
 
 81
 00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,793
 Has he been depressed?
 
 82
 00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,354
 He's been withdrawn lately.
 A little withdrawn.
 
 83
 00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,195
 Yeah.
 
 84
 00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,510
 Last night, he was agitated.
 
 85
 00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,789
 Agitated?
 
 86
 00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,278
 Yeah. When he came home last night,
 he was agitated, upset.
 
 87
 00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,029
 Upset in general? Or upset
 because of something particular?
 
 88
 00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,435
 When I asked him what was wrong,
 he said:
 
 89
 00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,079
 "I don't know where to begin."
 
 90
 00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,994
 Then he just walked out of the room—Out of the bathroom.
 
 91
 00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,758
 I was in the tub, taking a bath.
 
 92
 00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,872—and when I came out
 about 10 minutes later, he was gone.
 
 93
 00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,558
 Nothing else missing?
 
 94
 00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,554
 His keys, wallet, cell phone.
 Just what was on him.
 
 95
 00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,277
 But—What about the phone call?
 
 96
 00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,669
 I'm looking into it.
 
 97
 00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,636
 -What phone call?
 -Walt's cell phone rang.
 
 98
 00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,992
 He pulled it out, looked at it,
 and didn't answer it.
 
 99
 00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,670
 But then, a short time after,
 he wandered out of the bathroom.
 
 100
 00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,598
 I mean...
 
 101
 00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,552
 ...couldn't that be...
 
 102
 00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,557
 ...important, right?
 
 103
 00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,958
 Anything else you can think of?
 
 104
 00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,592
 Anything else.
 
 105
 00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,836
 No. I called
 the credit card providers...
 
 106
 00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,955
 ...and there's no report
 of any recent activity.
 
 107
 00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,312
 I-- Let's see. I checked
 with every hospital within 50 miles.
 
 108
 00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,511
 Every police station. Every morgue.
 
 109
 00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,280
 So, no, I really don't--
 I don't have anything else.
 
 110
 00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,836
 I was actually hoping
 that you had something else...
 
 111
 00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,429
 ...being that you're the expert.
 
 112
 00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,033
 I'm sorry.
 
 113
 00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,514
 No worries.
 
 114
 00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,315
 I think this is good enough to start.
 Gives us plenty to work on.
 
 115
 00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
 -Mrs. White.
 -Thank you.
 
 116
 00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,349
 -Walter.
 -Thank you.
 
 117
 00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,878
 So that cell-phone call
 she's talking about? I ran it.
 
 118
 00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,911
 -And?
 -Never happened.
 
 119
 00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,519
 No record of it.
 
 120
 00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,915
 -Second cell phone.
 -Yeah. I'm thinking.
 
 121
 00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,274
 I understand.
 
 122
 00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,919
 Out.
 
 123
 00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,989
 Get away from me!
 
 124
 00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,955
 Settle down, bitch.
 
 125
 00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,278
 You gonna shoot me, huh?
 Shoot me in here!
 
 126
 00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,675
 I hope I bleed like a mother too!
 
 127
 00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,836
 That way, you have to clean it up!
 
 128
 00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,994
 It's your ride, retard.
 
 129
 00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,031
 I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.
 
 130
 00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,752
 Get up.
 
 131
 00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,198
 Get up.
 
 132
 00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,473
 Oh, my God.
 
 133
 00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,671
 Don't do this, Tuco.
 
 134
 00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,877
 No more posters?
 
 135
 00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,028
 Walter Jr.'s making more.
 
 136
 00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,517
 Thank you, Marie.
 
 137
 00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,834
 I don't think he'll hurt himself.
 
 138
 00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,430
 I mean, he just doesn't strike me
 as the type.
 
 139
 00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,198
 He'll turn up.
 
 140
 00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,035
 Okay, the whole tiara thing...
 
 141
 00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,630
 -...I just find it bewildering that...
 -Marie.
 
 142
 00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,593
 -...you didn't believe that--
 -Marie.
 
 143
 00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,118
 Not now.
 
 144
 00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,152
 Empty your pockets.
 
 145
 00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,070
 Thought your name was
 Heisenberg...
 
 146
 00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,954
 ..."Walter Hartwell White."
 
 147
 00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,232
 Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.
 
 148
 00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,796
 You know, a business name.
 
 149
 00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,071
 Yeah.
 
 150
 00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,669
 I like doing business
 with a family man.
 
 151
 00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,350
 There's always a lot of collateral.
 
 152
 00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,554
 Answer me one thing.
 
 153
 00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,036
 Can I trust you?
 
 154
 00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,310
 Yes. Yes, absolutely.
 
 155
 00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,591
 Sit down.
 
 156
 00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,792
 DEA...
 
 157
 00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,075
 ...hit my place of business
 this morning.
 
 158
 00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,396
 About a hundred cops
 looking for me.
 
 159
 00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,917
 -You two haven't been talking, right?
 -No.
 
 160
 00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,473
 No.
 
 161
 00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,352
 Picked up my whole crew,
 top to bottom.
 
 162
 00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,473
 Everybody except Gonzo.
 
 163
 00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,636
 That's weird, right?
 
 164
 00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,150
 I mean, don't you think
 that that's weird?
 
 165
 00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,954
 It's weird. Yes.
 
 166
 00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,479
 Unusual.
 
 167
 00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,958
 Unusual.
 
 168
 00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,630
 Last two days,
 I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.
 
 169
 00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,952
 He's been acting all pouty
 on account of No-Doze.
 
 170
 00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,511
 Explain to me.
 
 171
 00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,596
 How is it my fault that that little
 bitch did not know his place?
 
 172
 00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,077
 I saw this coming.
 
 173
 00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,709
 I can see the future, you know?
 
 174
 00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,391
 It's this gift that I have
 deep inside my head.
 
 175
 00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,828
 I knew last night they were gonna
 come try and bust me.
 
 176
 00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,475
 Gonzo.
 
 177
 00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,754
 He went and snitched to the cops!
 That lousy son of a bitch!
 
 178
 00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,396
 I trusted him like a brother!
 I was good to him! I was good!
 
 179
 00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,036
 I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
 I'm gonna skin him...
 
 180
 00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,596
 ...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
 for a heavy bag...
 
 181
 00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,759
 ...and every time I hit him,
 it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!
 
 182
 00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,839
 You never,
 never trust the people that you love!
 
 183
 00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,557
 So you plan to ice Gonzo,
 like, future tense?
 
 184
 00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,595
 What?
 
 185
 00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,795
 You're saying, Tuco....
 
 186
 00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,673
 You're saying that Gonzo...
 
 187
 00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,998
 ...is currently operating
 as a police informant...
 
 188
 00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,349
 ...as far as you know?
 
 189
 00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,795
 I'm very sorry to hear that.
 
 190
 00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,712
 That's disappointing.
 
 191
 00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,275
 Yeah.
 
 192
 00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,313
 -I'd waste him too, yo.
 -Shut up.
 
 193
 00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,839
 Okay.
 
 194
 00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,794
 They're out there looking for me
 right now.
 
 195
 00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,673
 They got ghetto birds
 and black ops.
 
 196
 00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,839
 I need to get high.
 I need to get good and high.
 
 197
 00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,469
 What's with this gak?
 It smells like headcheese.
 
 198
 00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,550
 No, it's-- It's killer.
 
 199
 00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,234
 Yeah, seriously.
 
 200
 00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,479
 So I was thinking last night.
 
 201
 00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,238
 I came up with this great idea.
 
 202
 00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,797
 -Mexico?
 -We'll disappear way out in the jungle.
 
 203
 00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,672
 We'll set you up in a superlab.
 
 204
 00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,269
 We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.
 
 205
 00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,277
 And no Federales
 are gonna mess with us...
 
 206
 00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,596
 ...because I got my people there.
 
 207
 00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,518
 Connections.
 
 208
 00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,755
 We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
 Heisenberg, huh?
 
 209
 00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,951
 Tuco, I....
 
 210
 00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,670
 I have a wife and family.
 
 211
 00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,916
 So what? You'll get another one.
 
 212
 00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,999
 I don't want you to take
 this the wrong way, but I can't just...
 
 213
 00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,475
 ...uproot my life like that.
 
 214
 00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,557
 Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.
 
 215
 00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,118
 Who's talking to you?
 
 216
 00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,233
 You need me, man...
 
 217
 00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,477
 ...because I cooked that scante
 in your hands.
 
 218
 00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,632
 Yeah.
 
 219
 00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,353
 I'll tell you something, yo.
 
 220
 00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,279
 You never tried nothing like it.
 
 221
 00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,516
 Stink or no stink...
 
 222
 00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,998
 ...one bump,
 you'll be flying high for days.
 
 223
 00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,435
 It's a new product him
 and I've been working up.
 
 224
 00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,870
 Careful when you hit it.
 
 225
 00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,799
 It kicks like a 12 gauge
 when it comes on.
 
 226
 00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,150
 It's got a secret ingredient.
 
 227
 00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,793
 What secret ingredient?
 
 228
 00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,677
 Chilli powder.
 
 229
 00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,959
 I hate chilli powder.
 
 230
 00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,718
 This blue magic, this is money.
 
 231
 00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,828
 You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.
 
 232
 00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,954
 We're gonna rewrite history
 with this.
 
 233
 00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,799
 All right. Time to clean the menudo
 out from between your ears.
 
 234
 00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,750
 No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.
 
 235
 00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,871
 I need him very, very badly.
 
 236
 00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,229
 He's my partner.
 
 237
 00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,308
 And if he doesn't go, I don't go.
 
 238
 00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,477
 I'll tell you this. My cousins
 are driving up here right now...
 
 239
 00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,353
 ...to smuggle us back,
 and they're gonna be here by sunset...
 
 240
 00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,870
 ...and you're gonna be on that truck,
 or you're gonna be dead!
 
 241
 00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,279
 And you....
 
 242
 00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,313
 You better hope they got room
 in the trunk.
 
 243
 00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,114
 -Where are you going?
 -Louis is taking me to the train station.
 
 244
 00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,992
 We'll put these up.
 
 245
 00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,034
 -No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
 -He wants to help, let him help.
 
 246
 00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,516
 I mean, how long has it been
 since you've slept?
 
 247
 00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,637
 Yeah, she's right, Sky.
 Why don't you lay down a while?
 
 248
 00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,158
 For chrissake,
 you got a bun in the oven.
 
 249
 00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,556
 I got my cell if you need me.
 
 250
 00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,751
 -Okay?
 -Okay.
 
 251
 00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,635
 -Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
 -All right. Bye.
 
 252
 00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,756
 Actually, I think the very fact
 they haven't found him yet...
 
 253
 00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,712
 ...bodes well.
 
 254
 00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,952
 Well, I mean, if he—You know.
 
 255
 00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,872
 Somebody would've
 smelled something by now.
 
 256
 00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,556
 There's got to be something.
 
 257
 00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,557
 Some detail
 that we haven't picked up on.
 
 258
 00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,950
 -What about the second cell phone?
 -Jesus.
 
 259
 00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,630
 What? We can't just ignore
 a potential clue, Hank.
 
 260
 00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,996
 Okay. What are you talking about?
 
 261
 00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,079
 The call you said Walt got
 before he disappeared?
 
 262
 00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,475
 There's no record of it
 with the phone company.
 
 263
 00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,310
 No incoming,
 no dropped calls, nothing.
 
 264
 00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,476
 But his phone rang. I heard it.
 
 265
 00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,634
 All right. Well, then if that's the case,
 he must have a second phone.
 
 266
 00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,234
 Why? What sense would there be
 in that?
 
 267
 00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,352
 Yeah. All right. Okay.
 I'm not here to argue with you.
 
 268
 00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,872
 No, Hank. You can't just bring up
 secret cell phone and then drop it.
 
 269
 00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,036
 What does it mean?
 
 270
 00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,276
 I don't know, Sky.
 What do you want me to say?
 
 271
 00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,433
 It means Walt has a secret.
 
 272
 00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,315
 Everyone's got one from somebody,
 big or little.
 
 273
 00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,239
 -Okay. Everyone. Okay.
 -Skyler, come on.
 
 274
 00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,194
 He kept cancer from you for weeks.
 
 275
 00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,799
 Okay, then, let's assume
 there's a second cell phone.
 
 276
 00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,309
 So what?
 What, is he having an affair?
 
 277
 00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,757
 Walt? Please.
 
 278
 00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,353
 -What about the marijuana?
 -He's not on pot anymore.
 
 279
 00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,471
 Says who? Him?
 
 280
 00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,716
 Chemotherapy
 and marijuana go together...
 
 281
 00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,674
 ...like apple pie and Chevrolet.
 
 282
 00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,351
 Maybe he's addicted to the pot...
 
 283
 00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,516
 ...and he owes his drug dealer
 a lot of money.
 
 284
 00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,678
 Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
 like that.
 
 285
 00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,713
 How do you know? You didn't even
 know he had a second cell phone.
 
 286
 00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,476
 Hank, you have to question
 this drug-dealer person.
 
 287
 00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,193
 He may know something.
 
 288
 00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,029
 Well, I'm telling you,
 we're grasping at straws here.
 
 289
 00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,868
 Then grasp.
 
 290
 00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,912
 Excuse me, ma'am.
 
 291
 00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,832
 Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
 He around?
 
 292
 00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,312
 No. I'm afraid not.
 
 293
 00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,318
 -Why?
 -I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.
 
 294
 00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,752
 I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
 about my brother-in-law, Walter White.
 
 295
 00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,032
 He taught your son chemistry
 in high school.
 
 296
 00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,437
 Oh, Mr. White.
 Yes, I remember him.
 
 297
 00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,154
 -That was a long time ago.
 -Yes, ma'am.
 
 298
 00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,875
 It's my understanding that he
 and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.
 
 299
 00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,870
 -Really?
 -Yeah.
 
 300
 00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,233
 Mr. White must've seen
 some potential in Jesse.
 
 301
 00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,670
 He really tried to motivate him.
 
 302
 00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,155
 He was one of the few teachers
 who cared.
 
 303
 00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,078
 Yeah, Walt's that way.
 He's a good man.
 
 304
 00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,717
 I'm so sorry
 to hear about his illness.
 
 305
 00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,478
 Please pass along our best wishes.
 
 306
 00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,877
 I certainly will,
 as soon as he turns up.
 
 307
 00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,229
 He's missing, actually.
 
 308
 00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,593
 Just kind of walked off, or....
 
 309
 00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,956
 Anyway, which is why
 I'm going around...
 
 310
 00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,674
 ...trying to think of anyone
 who knows him, even slightly.
 
 311
 00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,518
 That's terrible.
 
 312
 00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,915
 Anything we can do to help.
 
 313
 00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,953
 Well, if you could put me in touch
 with your son....
 
 314
 00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,072
 Like I said,
 we're kind of desperate for leads.
 
 315
 00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,159
 Jesse's not answering either number,
 and no one seems to be at his house.
 
 316
 00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,319
 And why do you think my son
 and Mr. White would be in touch?
 
 317
 00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,318
 I don't necessarily. I just—318
 00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,636
 -Are you with the police?
 -No, ma'am. Not at all.
 
 319
 00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,713
 I'm with
 the Drug Enforcement Administration.
 
 320
 00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,394
 Oh, my God.
 
 321
 00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,635
 Is my son in trouble?
 
 322
 00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,195
 I have absolutely no reason
 to think that, no.
 
 323
 00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,789
 Do I need to get a lawyer?
 
 324
 00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,468
 You know, you don't seem
 very forthright about this...
 
 325
 00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,989
 ...coming here and asking questions
 about my son and—326
 00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,509
 Mrs. Pinkman,
 I'm not here on official capacity.
 
 327
 00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,235
 I do not care what your son may
 or may not have done wrong.
 
 328
 00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,112
 I just wanna find my brother-in-law.
 
 329
 00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,153
 His wife is worried sick,
 and she's got a baby on the way.
 
 330
 00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,034
 I'm sorry. I would like to help you...
 
 331
 00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,629
 ...but I have not seen my son
 in over a month.
 
 332
 00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,071
 I don't expect to see him
 anytime soon.
 
 333
 00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,796
 Well, thanks for your time.
 
 334
 00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,796
 If you could tell me one more thing.
 
 335
 00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,198
 Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
 Monte Carlo, as far as you know?
 
 336
 00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,591
 If he had spent half as much time
 and money on his education...
 
 337
 00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,839
 ...as he has
 on that ridiculous bouncing car....
 
 338
 00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
 Low rider, huh?
 
 339
 00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,753
 Gomey, hey.
 
 340
 00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
 No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
 do me a solid and check out...
 
 341
 00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,871
 ...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...
 
 342
 00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,312
 ...registered to a one
 Jesse Pinkman.
 
 343
 00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,512
 Specifically, I wanna know
 if the car's got a LoJack.
 
 344
 00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,110
 It's one of those jack-off low riders,
 so I'm betting there is.
 
 345
 00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,517
 If so, can you go ahead
 and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.
 
 346
 00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,271
 Chilli powder.
 
 347
 00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,150
 Did I not already tell you
 how moronic that was?
 
 348
 00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,634
 Whatever, man.
 
 349
 00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,512
 At least I tried something.
 
 350
 00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,551
 Hey, it almost worked too.
 
 351
 00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,718
 How's about
 you leaving my gun, huh?
 
 352
 00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,639
 First you boost it,
 then you leave it in your house.
 
 353
 00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,432
 My gun.
 
 354
 00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,998
 How was I supposed to know you were
 chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?
 
 355
 00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,237
 Well, at least he wants you alive.
 
 356
 00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,588
 Hey, I don't get it.
 
 357
 00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,678
 If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
 then who did?
 
 358
 00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,518
 I don't know.
 
 359
 00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,957
 I don't know.
 
 360
 00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,118
 Does it really matter?
 
 361
 00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,108
 If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
 and not a police informant...
 
 362
 00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,311
 ...who does he
 automatically blame?
 
 363
 00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,272
 Us.
 
 364
 00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,478
 We need a plan.
 
 365
 00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,751
 -Think, think.
 -Let's just bum-rush him, man.
 
 366
 00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,110
 You crack him over
 the head with something...
 
 367
 00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,276
 ...and I'll go for his gun.
 
 368
 00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,558
 Crack him over the head
 with something?
 
 369
 00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,194
 Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
 all right?
 
 370
 00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,992
 You're as good
 as checked out already.
 
 371
 00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,113
 Okay? You should be, like, all
 sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.
 
 372
 00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,673
 Just....
 
 373
 00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,594
 Oh, so my life
 is not the priority here...
 
 374
 00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,234
 ...because I'm gonna be
 dead soon anyway.
 
 375
 00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,158
 That's your point?
 
 376
 00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,279
 Yeah.
 
 377
 00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,718
 We gotta get him to take this.
 
 378
 00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,195
 Well, he don't much like
 the taste of chilli P.
 
 379
 00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,152
 That much has been established.
 
 380
 00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,193
 So unless you can convince him
 to booty bump....
 
 381
 00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,796
 Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.
 
 382
 00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,754
 Go on, sit. You're looking
 a little weak, Heisenberg.
 
 383
 00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,077
 I don't want you to go belly up
 before we get there.
 
 384
 00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,718
 Take it easy, ''Tio.''
 
 385
 00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,028
 I will feed you.
 I eat first. That's the deal.
 
 386
 00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,312
 What?
 
 387
 00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,591
 I get it, I get it, I get it.
 
 388
 00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,839
 Oh, you greedy old bastard.
 
 389
 00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,156
 I tell you, Heisenberg.
 
 390
 00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,188
 Old people.
 
 391
 00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,912
 You feed them, huh?
 
 392
 00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,634
 You put them in a really nice crib
 in the country...
 
 393
 00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,071
 ...and yet they gotta steal
 the food off your plate.
 
 394
 00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,398
 You better eat every bite of that.
 
 395
 00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,309
 What did you do that for?
 
 396
 00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,351
 God!
 
 397
 00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,035
 Hey, look. Look.
 
 398
 00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,798
 There's nothing left.
 
 399
 00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,630
 What? What do you want?
 
 400
 00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,999
 No.
 
 401
 00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,317
 Don't even tell me
 that you're hungry.
 
 402
 00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,714
 Don't go there.
 
 403
 00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,397
 Are you mad-dogging them, ''Tio?''
 
 404
 00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,113
 What, you don't like them?
 
 405
 00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,309
 One ding.
 
 406
 00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,751
 That means yes''. Tio'' don't like you.
 
 407
 00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,554
 Why don't you like them, ''Tio?''
 
 408
 00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,671
 You don't trust them?
 
 409
 00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,188
 -Why don't you trust them, ''Tio?''
 -Tuco, come on. He's....
 
 410
 00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,195
 There clearly some dementia.
 He's not lucid.
 
 411
 00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,758
 Did they do something to you, ''Tio?''
 
 412
 00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,992
 Something that you don't like?
 
 413
 00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,588
 What did they do to you?
 What did you do to my ''tio?''
 
 414
 00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,028
 Nothing. Nothing.
 
 415
 00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,836
 -Bullshit! My ''tio'' does not lie!
 -I don't know. I swear. I don't know.
 
 416
 00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,636
 No, I-- Maybe it was—I did change
 the channel on his TV, but....
 
 417
 00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,990
 Yeah, that's it.
 While you were cooking...
 
 418
 00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,556
 ...he was watching
 one of those telenovels...
 
 419
 00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,274
 ...with all those ripe honeys on it.
 He was really into it.
 
 420
 00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,072
 I told you
 not to change the channel.
 
 421
 00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,158
 You know, dude needs his eye candy.
 That's it.
 
 422
 00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,396
 Is that it, ''Tio?''
 
 423
 00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,916
 Is that it, ''Tio?''
 
 424
 00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,913
 Did they change your mamitas?
 
 425
 00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,756
 What are you telling me, ''Tio?''
 
 426
 00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,668
 Are they punking me?
 
 427
 00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,755
 Hey. No.
 
 428
 00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,236
 No, man. No.
 
 429
 00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,839
 -Come here!
 -No.
 
 430
 00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,430
 No, no, Tuco.
 
 431
 00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,878
 Tuco, no. Tuco.
 
 432
 00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,798
 Shut up!
 
 433
 00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,114
 No. Please, no. God. Please, no.
 
 434
 00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,709
 No, God. I don't wanna die.
 
 435
 00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,797
 Tell me what you did, Walter!
 
 436
 00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,151
 Jesus, I don't wanna die.
 
 437
 00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,957
 -No!
 -Tell me what you did!
 
 438
 00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,710
 We tried to poison you.
 
 439
 00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,276
 We tried to poison you...
 
 440
 00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,959
 ...because you're an insane,
 degenerate piece of filth...
 
 441
 00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,037
 ...and you deserve to die.
 
 442
 00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,036
 Who's the bitch now?
 
 443
 00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,591
 Let him bleed.
 
 444
 00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,352
 The keys.
 
 445
 00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,833
 Tuco.
 
 446
 00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,192
 Oh, my God.
 
 447
 00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,513
 The cousins?
 
 448
 00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,348
 What the hell is going on?
 
 449
 00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,477
 Jesse Pinkman.
 
 450
 00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,316
 You're a hard man to find.
 
 451
 00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,310
 Oh, shit.
 
 452
 00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,758
 Easy.
 
 453
 00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,510
 Oh, my God.
 
 454
 00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,437
 Oh, God. Hank.
 
 455
 00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,993
 -Who? -Hank.
 
 456
 00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,519
 What?
 
 457
 00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,358
 -Oh, my God.
 -What?
 
 458
 00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,597
 -Oh, my God.
 -Stay. What are you doing?
