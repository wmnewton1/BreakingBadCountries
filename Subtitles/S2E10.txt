 1
 00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,754
 You're not thinking about
 going to work today, are you?
 
 2
 00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,432
 Thought I would. That inhaler really
 seems to be doing the trick.
 
 3
 00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,556
 -What?
 -Just take the rest of the week.
 
 4
 00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,354
 Please. You've earned it.
 
 5
 00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,198
 Don't push it.
 
 6
 00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,392
 Besides, I want you well
 for the weekend.
 
 7
 00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,949
 Mom wants to party.
 
 8
 00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,675
 It's just a little get-together,
 that's all.
 
 9
 00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,111
 Sunday afternoon, maybe?
 Nothing too big.
 
 10
 00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,073
 Just family and a few friends.
 
 11
 00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,393
 We've got a lot to celebrate.
 Don't you think?
 
 12
 00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,753
 Sounds good.
 
 13
 00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,593
 Oh, thank you.
 
 14
 00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,358
 Now...
 
 15
 00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,310
 ...what are you supposed
 to do today?
 
 16
 00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,717
 -Nothing.
 -Excellent.
 
 17
 00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,915
 Brownie points for taking a nap.
 
 18
 00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,633
 Can you meet?
 
 19
 00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,633
 I thought maybe you
 might have, you know...
 
 20
 00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,239
 ...kicked.
 
 21
 00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,670
 Signed—Signed off.
 
 22
 00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,348
 I was even checking the obits.
 
 23
 00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,478
 No such luck.
 
 24
 00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,358
 So where does it stand?
 
 25
 00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,629
 Coughing up blood,
 giving speeches, you know, like:
 
 26
 00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,593
 "I deserve this. I'm an asshole."
 
 27
 00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,438
 What's the upshot?
 
 28
 00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,674
 The upshot.
 
 29
 00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,717
 The upshot is that
 I have radiation pneumonitis.
 
 30
 00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,715
 Damn.
 
 31
 00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,115
 Actually, it's not
 as bad as it sounds.
 
 32
 00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,473
 It's a fairly common occurrence,
 easily treated.
 
 33
 00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,197
 In fact...
 
 34
 00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,233
 ...the news is all good.
 
 35
 00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,878
 What do you mean, good?
 
 36
 00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
 You mean, like, "good" good?
 
 37
 00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,518
 What, you mean, like,
 remission good?
 
 38
 00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,989
 Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
 I still have cancer.
 
 39
 00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,275
 But there's been a significant
 reduction in the tumours.
 
 40
 00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,917
 How significant?
 
 41
 00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,192
 Eighty percent.
 
 42
 00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,471
 Dude. No way.
 
 43
 00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,638
 Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
 not by any stretch...
 
 44
 00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,635
 ...but "options" is the word
 they keep bandying about.
 
 45
 00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,673
 That's awesome. Serious?
 
 46
 00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,474
 That's-- That's great, man.
 
 47
 00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,070
 I mean, my aunt, she never—I mean, you know, at your stage...
 
 48
 00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,396
 ...I didn't think that could happen.
 
 49
 00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,999
 Yeah.
 
 50
 00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,590
 Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!
 
 51
 00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,473
 No. You must be so psyched.
 
 52
 00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,397
 Of course. I am.
 
 53
 00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,835
 Okay, now we....
 
 54
 00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,075
 I mean, what do we...?
 
 55
 00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,113
 Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
 
 56
 00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,109
 So how do you want to...
 
 57
 00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,228
 ...you know, proceed...
 
 58
 00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
 ...in light of this kick-ass news?
 
 59
 00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,078
 We'll take our time
 and stay cautious.
 
 60
 00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,191
 Sell off what we have.
 
 61
 00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,958
 And then....
 
 62
 00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,477
 Well, then I guess...
 
 63
 00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
 ...I'm done.
 
 64
 00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,435
 -Batter up.
 -Everyone?
 
 65
 00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,760
 Hey, you guys.
 I would like to make a toast...
 
 66
 00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,717
 -...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
 -Somebody kill the music.
 
 67
 00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,597
 I know one party
 can't begin to repay...
 
 68
 00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,794
 ...all your support
 and your many, many kindnesses.
 
 69
 00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,195
 But then again...
 
 70
 00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,757
 ...Hank does make
 one mean margarita.
 
 71
 00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,912
 We really do want to thank you.
 
 72
 00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,396
 These last few months have been...
 
 73
 00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,511
 ...wow, a challenging time,
 to put it mildly.
 
 74
 00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,075
 But I have to say
 Walt's come through it like a champ.
 
 75
 00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,272
 -All right.
 -Honey, I'm so proud of you.
 
 76
 00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,078
 We all are.
 
 77
 00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,430
 Okay, I'm gonna stop
 with the sappy stuff. I am.
 
 78
 00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,517
 But it's true. It really is.
 
 79
 00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,030
 And for the first time
 in a long time...
 
 80
 00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,073
 ...we are so excited about the future.
 
 81
 00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,513
 Okay, anyway...
 
 82
 00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,280
 ...I want to also
 express my gratitude...
 
 83
 00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,235
 ...to two very special people
 who couldn't be here today.
 
 84
 00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,273
 But they send their regrets
 and their warm wishes.
 
 85
 00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,152
 Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...
 
 86
 00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,238
 ...for those of you
 who don't know them, are....
 
 87
 00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,031
 Well, they're heroes.
 
 88
 00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,994
 They are incredibly generous friends
 who made the amazing offer...
 
 89
 00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,873
 ...to pay for Walt's treatment.
 
 90
 00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,478
 And they did.
 
 91
 00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,199
 So...
 
 92
 00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,313
 ...to Gretchen and Elliott.
 
 93
 00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,076
 -To Gretchen and Elliot.
 -Cheers.
 
 94
 00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,033
 Hey, how about the man of the hour?
 Come on.
 
 95
 00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,559
 -Speech.
 -Yes.
 
 96
 00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,193
 -Speech.
 -Yeah, Dad.
 
 97
 00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,675
 Come on, Walt. Speech.
 
 98
 00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,478
 Well, it's....
 
 99
 00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,159
 It's kind of funny.
 
 100
 00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,595
 When I got my diagnosis, cancer...
 
 101
 00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,790
 ...I said to myself, you know:
 
 102
 00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,189
 "Why me?"
 
 103
 00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,799
 And then...
 
 104
 00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,112
 ...the other day,
 when I got the good news...
 
 105
 00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,430
 ...I said the same thing.
 
 106
 00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,794
 Anyway.
 
 107
 00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,877
 Thank you for coming.
 
 108
 00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,517
 And enjoy.
 
 109
 00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,199
 -All right, cheers.
 -Yeah.
 
 110
 00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,674
 Cheers.
 
 111
 00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,998
 Inspirational.
 
 112
 00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,312
 Tell you what. I gotta give
 those bastards points for originality.
 
 113
 00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,509
 I'll tell you that much.
 
 114
 00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,156
 A little mercury switch,
 9-volt battery...
 
 115
 00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,319
 ...five or six ounces of C-4,
 that's how those cartel boys party.
 
 116
 00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,194
 Yeah, but why a turtle?
 
 117
 00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,960
 Oh, that's the best part. It was a....
 
 118
 00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,469
 It was a.... What the hell's the word
 I'm looking for?
 
 119
 00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,191
 Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
 it's a....
 
 120
 00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,789
 Walt, what's the word
 I'm looking for?
 
 121
 00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,993
 Anyway...
 
 122
 00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,795
 ...Tortuga. Okay?
 That was the name of our snitch.
 
 123
 00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,195
 Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?
 
 124
 00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,916
 Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
 I never knew the difference myself.
 
 125
 00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,395
 Hey, top me off there,
 will you, buddy?
 
 126
 00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,192
 Anyway.
 
 127
 00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,153
 Poetic.
 
 128
 00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,194
 I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
 That's the word.
 
 129
 00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,231
 I guess that's the word.
 
 130
 00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,435
 Go ahead.
 
 131
 00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,712
 Better not let your mom see.
 
 132
 00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,275
 Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
 Maybe two.
 
 133
 00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,433
 -There's no worm in this, right?
 -No, that would be mescal.
 
 134
 00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,835
 Talk about your hangovers, okay?
 
 135
 00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,998
 I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
 I was back east, doing some training.
 
 136
 00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,431
 Had this firearm instructor
 who was....
 
 137
 00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,200
 He was a good old boy, you know?
 Hey. There you go. Thanks.
 
 138
 00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,631
 I mean, this guy could put them away
 like he had two livers, okay?
 
 139
 00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,354
 Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.
 
 140
 00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,437
 We were drinking mescal stupid.
 
 141
 00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,676
 But—Hey, hey.
 
 142
 00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,634
 Walt, what you doing there?
 
 143
 00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,473
 What does it look like I'm doing?
 
 144
 00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,598
 The kid's 16.
 
 145
 00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,111
 What are you going for,
 Father of the Year?
 
 146
 00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,756
 What are you looking at him for?
 
 147
 00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,432
 We're celebrating. Come on.
 
 148
 00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,993
 That's all right.
 
 149
 00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,588
 No.
 
 150
 00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,118
 Jesus.
 
 151
 00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,429
 Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
 if I were you, okay?
 
 152
 00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,677
 Think we've been bogarting
 this puppy long enough.
 
 153
 00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,153
 Hey.
 
 154
 00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,669
 Bring the bottle back.
 
 155
 00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,518
 Sorry, buddy. No can do.
 
 156
 00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,398
 It's my son. My bottle. My house.
 
 157
 00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,997
 -It's all right.
 -What are you waiting for?
 
 158
 00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,349
 Bring it back.
 
 159
 00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,671
 Why don't we just call it a day?
 
 160
 00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,399
 All right, pal?
 
 161
 00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,877
 -We good?
 -The bottle.
 
 162
 00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,869
 Now.
 
 163
 00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,797
 What's going on?
 
 164
 00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,353
 Jesus.
 
 165
 00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,555
 Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.
 
 166
 00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,352
 Oh, my God.
 
 167
 00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,391
 Okay. Okay.
 
 168
 00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,677
 There you go. Okay. That's it.
 
 169
 00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,075
 Just get it out. That's okay.
 
 170
 00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,989
 This is your brain.
 
 171
 00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,432
 This is your brain on drugs.
 
 172
 00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,751
 You weren't supposed to wake up.
 
 173
 00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,076
 Ever or...?
 
 174
 00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,670
 No, I was just thinking
 that I'd bring it, you know, in.
 
 175
 00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,276
 You want me to go back to bed?
 
 176
 00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,956
 No, I guess that'd be kind of—177
 00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,358
 No.
 
 178
 00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,319
 Need some help?
 
 179
 00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,351
 No, I got it.
 
 180
 00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,479
 Just have a seat.
 
 181
 00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,432
 Is there any coffee?
 
 182
 00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,715
 Yeah, shit. One second.
 
 183
 00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,797
 Well, at least let me do that.
 
 184
 00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,037
 No, I don't want you to have
 to do anything, you know?
 
 185
 00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,150
 All right. Here.
 You take the good one.
 
 186
 00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,239
 It's huevos rancheros.
 
 187
 00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,234
 -I can tell.
 -Yeah?
 
 188
 00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,075
 -Fork.
 -Oh, yeah.
 
 189
 00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,839
 There you go.
 
 190
 00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,396
 So, what are you up to today?
 Working?
 
 191
 00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,956
 -Whatever that means.
 -No.
 
 192
 00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,438
 I'm all yours.
 
 193
 00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,789
 Really?
 
 194
 00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,474
 ''Hey, this is Skyler.''
 ''Please leave me a message. Thanks.''
 
 195
 00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,874
 Hi.
 
 196
 00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,151
 I just wanted to say that....
 
 197
 00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,509
 No.
 
 198
 00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,393
 We'll talk tonight...
 
 199
 00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,229
 ...but I wanted to say that...
 
 200
 00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,037
 ...I'm not exactly sure
 who that was yesterday...
 
 201
 00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,071
 ...but it wasn't me.
 
 202
 00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,279
 And I'm sorry.
 
 203
 00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,113
 Love you.
 
 204
 00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,758
 Oh, boy.
 
 205
 00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,795
 ''I just wanted to say that....''
 
 206
 00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,149
 ''No.''
 
 207
 00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,872
 ''We'll talk tonight,''
 ''but I wanted to say that....''
 
 208
 00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,399
 Hey there.
 
 209
 00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,354
 -Wow, who brought the churros?
 -That would be me.
 
 210
 00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,870
 If I leave them at home, I'll just
 wind up eating them all myself, so....
 
 211
 00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,838
 They're actually—They're leftovers.
 We had a little get-together for Walt.
 
 212
 00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,871
 It wasn't his birthday, was it?
 
 213
 00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,838
 Actually...
 
 214
 00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,598
 ...Walt's got....
 
 215
 00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,469
 He's been battling cancer.
 
 216
 00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,033
 -Skyler--
 -And last week we got good news.
 
 217
 00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,199
 -I'm so sorry.
 -But we're really optimistic.
 
 218
 00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,674
 Great.
 
 219
 00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,390
 -Great. Good news is great.
 -Yeah.
 
 220
 00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,955
 Yeah, it is. It really is.
 
 221
 00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,393
 Well...
 
 222
 00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,354
 ...feel free to bring these any time.
 
 223
 00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,039
 Yeah.
 
 224
 00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,915
 Got some real beauts.
 
 225
 00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,434
 You cannot beat
 the thermal efficiency of the C3.
 
 226
 00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,119
 Yeah?
 
 227
 00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,078
 Then again, what about tankless?
 
 228
 00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,278
 Sure. We got them.
 
 229
 00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,994
 The good ones will
 really run up your price though.
 
 230
 00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,158
 Set you back about 1200.
 
 231
 00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,435
 It's not an issue.
 
 232
 00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,348
 You want installation, right?
 
 233
 00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,997
 -No. I'm gonna do it myself.
 -That's what I like to hear.
 
 234
 00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,152
 And who's this?
 This guy can surf without a board?
 
 235
 00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,270
 That's Hover Man.
 
 236
 00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,233
 He can surf, skate, glide...
 
 237
 00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,797
 ...whatever, because he's always got
 a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.
 
 238
 00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,389
 That's cool. Great lines.
 
 239
 00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,910
 And this guy?
 What's his superpower?
 
 240
 00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,989
 That's Kanga-man.
 
 241
 00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,668
 Kanga-man?
 Half-man, half-kangaroo?
 
 242
 00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,989
 -And who's this in his pouch?
 -His sidekick, Joey.
 
 243
 00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,638
 He rides around in his pouch
 and, you know...
 
 244
 00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,354
 ...fights crime.
 
 245
 00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,393
 So that makes Kanga-man a she.
 
 246
 00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,912
 You know that, right?
 
 247
 00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,595
 Only female kangaroos
 have pouches.
 
 248
 00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,199
 Yeah, yeah, I know.
 
 249
 00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,755
 But, you know, it's definitely a dude.
 
 250
 00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,155
 He's a product of experimentation.
 
 251
 00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,195
 He's kind of hot, I guess.
 Nice haunches.
 
 252
 00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,511
 -And this is?
 -It's Backwardo.
 
 253
 00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,273
 Wait, no. I actually—I changed it to Rewindo.
 
 254
 00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,471
 Anyways, he goes backwards.
 
 255
 00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,272
 He can make everything
 go in reverse.
 
 256
 00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,436
 Time and stuff? Like time travelling?
 
 257
 00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,074
 No, he just walks backwards.
 
 258
 00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,950
 He walks backwards?
 
 259
 00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,198
 Is that a superpower?
 What good is that?
 
 260
 00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,675
 No, I mean, he does it,
 like, really fast.
 
 261
 00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,678
 Okay, look, say someone's
 coming at him with a knife, right?
 
 262
 00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,031
 I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
 zip backwards away from them.
 
 263
 00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,832
 Okay.
 
 264
 00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,429
 Yo, I was a kid...
 
 265
 00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,119
 ...when I drew all these.
 
 266
 00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,750
 It was like four years ago.
 
 267
 00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,558
 -They all look like you.
 -What?
 
 268
 00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,475
 It's you in all of these.
 
 269
 00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,713
 No.
 
 270
 00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,798
 I wonder what a shrink would say
 if he saw them.
 
 271
 00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,070
 Oh, shut up.
 
 272
 00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,236
 Like you never wanted
 a superpower.
 
 273
 00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,516
 -Is that your door or mine?
 -I don't know.
 
 274
 00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,597
 It sounds like mine.
 
 275
 00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,396
 -I gotta go.
 -Where?
 
 276
 00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,394
 Hey, where?
 
 277
 00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,356
 Hey, hold up. Where are you...?
 
 278
 00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,879
 Jane.
 
 279
 00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,753
 Jane.
 
 280
 00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,875
 -Hey, Dad.
 -There you are.
 
 281
 00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,233
 Hi, honey.
 
 282
 00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,273
 I saw your car, so I was
 pretty sure you were home.
 
 283
 00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,478
 Yeah, sorry. I was working.
 I had my headphones on.
 
 284
 00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,796
 Finally realised that
 I wasn't the drum track?
 
 285
 00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,395
 -Exactly.
 -Well, I was in the neighbourhood.
 
 286
 00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,239
 Was wondering if you wanted
 to grab some lunch.
 
 287
 00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,634
 Sure. Yeah.
 
 288
 00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,353
 Hey, this your dad?
 
 289
 00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,193
 -Yes.
 -Hello.
 
 290
 00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,594
 Hi.
 
 291
 00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,438
 This is the new tenant.
 
 292
 00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,154
 -Donald.
 -Jesse.
 
 293
 00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,595
 I'm sorry. Did you need something?
 
 294
 00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,112
 -No.
 -Dad, why don't you come in?
 
 295
 00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,833
 It was nice seeing you.
 
 296
 00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,873
 -It was nice to meet you.
 -You too.
 
 297
 00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,639
 Hey, Dad.
 
 298
 00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,589
 -Hey, son. Are you home early?
 -No.
 
 299
 00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,318
 Oh, man.
 
 300
 00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,790
 It was a good day?
 
 301
 00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,836
 Now it is. Finally, hot water.
 No more toxic waste.
 
 302
 00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,951
 Yes. Yes, indeed.
 
 303
 00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,516
 Top of the line, on demand,
 unlimited supply.
 
 304
 00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,039
 -Sweet.
 -Yeah.
 
 305
 00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,153
 -Hey, want to take her for a spin?
 -Oh, yeah.
 
 306
 00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,916
 Listen, why don't you
 go to the kitchen sink?
 
 307
 00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,192
 Let me know when you're ready,
 and I'll give you a holler.
 
 308
 00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,913
 Okay.
 
 309
 00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,718
 Pilot in.
 
 310
 00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,480
 Ignition. Bingo.
 
 311
 00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,193
 Okay.
 
 312
 00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,633
 -Ready.
 -All right. Let her rip.
 
 313
 00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,311
 Hundred and seventeen
 thousand BTUs.
 
 314
 00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,431
 -Oh, yeah?
 -Oh, yeah.
 
 315
 00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,949
 Built-in corrosion-resistant
 draught reducer...
 
 316
 00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,515
 ...safety thermocouple
 with the pilot burner.
 
 317
 00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,711
 Sounds really good, Dad.
 
 318
 00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,998
 And the energy savings. I mean....
 
 319
 00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,236
 Oh, careful, careful, careful.
 
 320
 00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,113
 There's probably some adjustments
 I need to make. You okay?
 
 321
 00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,834
 -Yeah, I'm fine.
 -Okay.
 
 322
 00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,359
 Son...
 
 323
 00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,795
 -...about yesterday--
 -I'm sorry about the pool.
 
 324
 00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,068
 No, no, no, that was not your fault.
 Not at all.
 
 325
 00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,879
 See, your....
 
 326
 00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,556
 Your old man embarrassed himself...
 
 327
 00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,910
 ...and I'm not very proud
 of my behaviour.
 
 328
 00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,749
 I have to say I feel very foolish.
 
 329
 00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,194
 You and Uncle Hank,
 you seemed pissed off.
 
 330
 00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,597
 No. No. We're fine.
 Everything's fine.
 
 331
 00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,509
 I called him this morning
 and made my apologies.
 
 332
 00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,750
 But, son, I owe you
 an apology most of all.
 
 333
 00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,473
 I should have used
 better judgement all around.
 
 334
 00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,512
 Having you drink in the first place,
 it was not right...
 
 335
 00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,790
 ...and for that I'm very sorry.
 
 336
 00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,158
 But I kept up, right?
 
 337
 00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,994
 You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.
 
 338
 00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,196
 I have some tools to put away.
 
 339
 00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,159
 Hey.
 
 340
 00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,395
 Yo.
 
 341
 00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,670
 You want to catch a movie later?
 
 342
 00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,353
 Yo.
 
 343
 00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,751
 -What?
 -What was that all about?
 
 344
 00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,954
 What?
 
 345
 00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,470
 Before. With your dad.
 
 346
 00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,113
 It wasn't about anything.
 
 347
 00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,155
 Oh, okay, so I totally
 just misread your total dis?
 
 348
 00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,510
 If anything, I was doing you a favour.
 
 349
 00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,233
 A favour?
 
 350
 00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,030
 Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.
 
 351
 00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,834
 -He seemed cool to me.
 -Yeah, well.
 
 352
 00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,237
 -So, what's the deal?
 -There's no deal.
 
 353
 00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,637
 I was helping you out, okay?
 Protecting you.
 
 354
 00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,273
 -How's that?
 -I mean...
 
 355
 00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,393
 ...I'm letting you smoke in here
 and everything.
 
 356
 00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,549
 I bought a filter.
 
 357
 00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,035
 And I figured
 the less he knows, the better.
 
 358
 00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,155
 You acted like
 you didn't even know me.
 
 359
 00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,759
 So?
 
 360
 00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,277
 -So?
 -You think I'm gonna be all like:
 
 361
 00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,436
 "Dad, meet the stoner guy
 who lives next door.
 
 362
 00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,995
 And by the way,
 I'm sleeping with him"?
 
 363
 00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,633
 That's all you think you're doing?
 
 364
 00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,350
 -Why do you even care about my dad?
 -I don't.
 
 365
 00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,755
 Good. Then I don't know
 why we're talking about it.
 
 366
 00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,430
 Us. All right? I'm talking about us.
 
 367
 00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,949
 -Us.
 -Yeah.
 
 368
 00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,075
 You and me.
 
 369
 00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,910
 Who's you and me?
 
 370
 00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,033
 I'm out of here.
 
 371
 00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,159
 Oh, boy.
 
 372
 00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,393
 Dad?
 
 373
 00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,869
 Dad? Hello?
 
 374
 00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,198
 What? Oh, hey.
 
 375
 00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,148
 -What are you doing?
 -We've got rot.
 
 376
 00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,874
 -Rot?
 -Yeah. Here.
 
 377
 00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,389
 I'll show you. Here.
 
 378
 00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,589
 Take a look at that.
 
 379
 00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,838
 See that? Yeah.
 Ever seen anything like it?
 
 380
 00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,635
 -It's wood.
 -It's wood...
 
 381
 00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,478
 ...that contains fruiting bodies.
 
 382
 00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,309
 Fruity what?
 
 383
 00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,633
 Fungus. And it is on a rampage.
 
 384
 00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,796
 I don't really see anything.
 
 385
 00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,310
 Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
 to know where to look. Here.
 
 386
 00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,031
 Then you cut it all out.
 
 387
 00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,551
 You just cut it out and start fresh.
 
 388
 00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,200
 Well, better get to it.
 
 389
 00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,358
 Is the whole house
 gonna collapse or something?
 
 390
 00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,917
 Not if I can help it.
 
 391
 00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,715
 Hey. You bucking for a promotion?
 
 392
 00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,630
 -Go home already.
 -I will. I will.
 
 393
 00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,189
 Hey, can I just ask...
 
 394
 00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,754
 -...the Keller account?
 -The Keller account?
 
 395
 00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,475
 It's listed as a current asset
 on this balance sheet...
 
 396
 00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,559
 ...but the invoice was never presented
 to accounts receivable, so....
 
 397
 00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,749
 Oh, God.
 
 398
 00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,032
 One of these days I'm gonna just
 sort through all the Dad stuff.
 
 399
 00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,391
 He had so many "Don't worry about it,
 pay me Friday" relationships...
 
 400
 00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,511
 ...with these little companies.
 
 401
 00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,157
 We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.
 
 402
 00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,553
 Right.
 
 403
 00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,113
 Seriously, you're not gonna
 make me lock you in, are you?
 
 404
 00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,193
 Sky?
 
 405
 00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,315
 Skyler?
 
 406
 00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,078
 Jesus.
 
 407
 00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,356
 No, I'm fine.
 
 408
 00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,439
 It's hormones. Honestly.
 It happens all the time.
 
 409
 00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,352
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 
 410
 00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,559
 What's wrong?
 
 411
 00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,792
 I guess it just...
 
 412
 00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,750
 ...doesn't feel any different.
 
 413
 00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,952
 The good news?
 
 414
 00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,073
 I mean, nothing's really changed.
 
 415
 00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,756
 It's just postponed.
 
 416
 00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,558
 There was supposed to be a light
 at the end of the tunnel.
 
 417
 00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,955
 But lately, it just feels like....
 
 418
 00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,398
 More tunnel.
 
 419
 00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,552
 I'm sorry.
 
 420
 00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,954
 I just feel so damn ungrateful.
 
 421
 00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,631
 I don't know.
 
 422
 00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,112
 For me, it was the flu.
 
 423
 00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,831
 -What?
 -My dad rallied at the end.
 
 424
 00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,315
 I mean, it wasn't the full-on
 good news Walt got...
 
 425
 00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,954
 ...different circumstances,
 but we were happy...
 
 426
 00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,718
 ...we were over the moon.
 
 427
 00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,037
 And right then, I got sick.
 
 428
 00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,114
 Flu.
 Knocked me on my ass for days.
 
 429
 00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,073
 Couldn't get out of bed,
 I couldn't move.
 
 430
 00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,034
 -Great timing, huh?
 -Yeah.
 
 431
 00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,875
 And I wasn't even putting two
 and two together. I was just thinking:
 
 432
 00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,593
 "Why now?"
 
 433
 00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,437
 Being that rock.
 
 434
 00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,959
 You know...
 
 435
 00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,678
 ...being that rock
 takes everything you got.
 
 436
 00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,199
 Yeah.
 
 437
 00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,071
 ''--causing the housing prices''
 ''to trend.''
 
 438
 00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,636
 ''Foreclosures are being fuelled''
 ''by a spike in....''
 
 439
 00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,559
 ''The economy is rapidly deteriorating''
 ''and unemployment is climbing.''
 
 440
 00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,355
 ''With Americans losing money over''
 ''rising inflation and tight spending...''
 
 441
 00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,915
 ''...the housing market''
 ''is unlikely to rebound...''
 
 442
 00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,680
 ''...spelling more pain''
 ''for the economy.''
 
 443
 00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,033
 Yeah.
 
 444
 00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,954
 Are you going to work today?
 
 445
 00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,316
 Skyler, there's rot.
 
 446
 00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,433
 I'm going back.
 
 447
 00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,795
 All right. We'll take care of that
 tomorrow. Okay, good night.
 
 448
 00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,910
 -Good night, Ted.
 -Good night.
 
 449
 00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,151
 Oh, damn.
 
 450
 00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,952
 -Clumsy.
 -I got it.
 
 451
 00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,310
 No, no, Ted.
 You don't have to do that.
 
 452
 00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,596
 ''Get organised. Storage containers''
 ''to meet every need...''
 
 453
 00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,268
 ''...big or small, on Aisle 3.''
 
 454
 00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,995
 ''Stashing your stuff''
 ''has never been so easy.''
 
 455
 00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,597
 ''Get a thicker, fuller lawn''
 ''in less than six weeks.''
 
 456
 00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,837
 ''Why can't the grass''
 ''always be greener on your side?''
 
 457
 00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,554
 ''Go to Aisle 10 to go green.''
 
 458
 00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,598
 ''Get a manager''
 ''on Check out 4, please.''
 
 459
 00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,836
 ''Manager to Check out 4.''
 
 460
 00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,957
 ''Pest problems? No problem.''
 
 461
 00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,789
 ''Your extermination destination''
 ''is Aisle 6.''
 
 462
 00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,116
 You're buying the wrong matches.
 
 463
 00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,671
 -What?
 -Those matches.
 
 464
 00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,074
 They're the wrong kind.
 
 465
 00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,309
 Red phosphorous is found
 in the striker strips...
 
 466
 00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,317
 ...not the matches themselves.
 
 467
 00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,069
 You need to get the big 200-count box
 of individual matchbooks.
 
 468
 00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,998
 More striker strips. You understand?
 
 469
 00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,836
 Those only have the one.
 
 470
 00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,429
 And don't buy everything
 in one place.
 
 471
 00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,834
 Do it piecemeal.
 
 472
 00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,350
 Different items, different stores.
 Attracts less attention.
 
 473
 00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,599
 Are you following me here?
 
 474
 00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,511
 ''You've been putting off''
 ''refinishing that deck long enough.''
 
 475
 00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,154
 ''We have everything you need''
 ''to do the job right.''
 
 476
 00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,553
 -Thanks.
 -Sure.
 
 477
 00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,716
 -Next.
 -Hi. Here you go.
 
 478
 00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,756
 -You didn't buy my stuff?
 -No, I didn't.
 
 479
 00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,473
 We don't have time for this.
 
 480
 00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,796
 Hey, there he is. That's the guy.
 
 481
 00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,077
 Stay out of my territory.
