 1
 00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,594
 Well, we've come a long way, Walt.
 
 2
 00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,279
 Here at the end of round one...
 
 3
 00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,630
 ...I'm gonna recommend
 cautious optimism.
 
 4
 00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
 We'll check back in two months,
 see how you've responded...
 
 5
 00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,759
 ...reassess and decide our next move,
 if any.
 
 6
 00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,599
 That's right around the time
 the baby's due, correct?
 
 7
 00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,508
 Yeah.
 
 8
 00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,551
 Well, try to think of this
 as good timing.
 
 9
 00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,194
 You'll start feeling better soon,
 more like yourself.
 
 10
 00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,197
 And your hair should start
 to come back.
 
 11
 00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,718
 Kind of gotten used
 to the old cue-ball look.
 
 12
 00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,072
 -I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
 -Right. Aerodynamic.
 
 13
 00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,478
 So no more confusion?
 
 14
 00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,992
 -No more--?
 -No. No. Absolutely none.
 
 15
 00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,519
 How are you two holding up?
 
 16
 00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,675
 Fine.
 
 17
 00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,872
 I mean, you know, we're busy...
 
 18
 00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
 ...but we're good. Absolutely.
 
 19
 00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,519
 It's all good.
 
 20
 00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,153
 So we're not going through an insurer.
 Is that correct?
 
 21
 00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,157
 Yes. Direct bill.
 
 22
 00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,715
 Just need to print it out for you.
 
 23
 00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,598
 Thank you.
 
 24
 00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,270
 I thought we had discussed
 a cash discount.
 
 25
 00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,994
 Absolutely. It's included.
 
 26
 00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,872
 Just a reminder.
 
 27
 00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,675
 We do have a payment plan available,
 should you be interested.
 
 28
 00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,075
 Oh, yeah.
 
 29
 00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,713
 Okay.
 
 30
 00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,553
 Congratulations.
 
 31
 00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,438
 Thank you.
 
 32
 00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,638
 Okay, well,
 then what about the MRI?
 
 33
 00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,796
 Can you--?
 Can you please explain to me...
 
 34
 00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,039
 ...the distinction between
 diagnostic and exploratory?
 
 35
 00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,152
 Yeah, but either way,
 his doctor ordered it.
 
 36
 00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,792
 Okay, you know,
 it should be covered.
 
 37
 00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,670
 You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.
 
 38
 00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,158
 Okay. Well, I'm sorry
 you couldn't be of more help too.
 
 39
 00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,271
 Yeah. Okay.
 
 40
 00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,959
 Bitch.
 
 41
 00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,759
 Hi.
 
 42
 00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,198
 Been around someone
 who smokes?
 
 43
 00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,594
 No.
 
 44
 00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,711
 The hospital bill came.
 
 45
 00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,797
 -That was fast.
 -Yeah.
 
 46
 00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,913
 Three-day stay,
 13,000 and counting.
 
 47
 00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,436
 Is this something that
 Gretchen and Elliott might cover?
 
 48
 00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,239
 I mean...
 
 49
 00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,399
 ...I know it's strictly your domain,
 but....
 
 50
 00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,591
 They will. I'm sure they will.
 
 51
 00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,358
 I'll handle it.
 
 52
 00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,396
 Oh, God.
 
 53
 00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,631
 Bring me up to speed on
 Tuco Salamanca.
 
 54
 00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,829
 -Dead.
 -Still?
 
 55
 00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,156
 -Completely.
 -Okay, then.
 
 56
 00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,794
 -Well, thanks for stopping by.
 -Okay.
 
 57
 00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,757
 So things are quiet, you know.
 Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.
 
 58
 00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,190
 -Good.
 -Of course, that's not gonna last.
 
 59
 00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,233
 Wait to see who rallies the roaches
 now that turf's up for grabs.
 
 60
 00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,793
 No takers so far?
 
 61
 00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,197
 Well, we keep hearing a name.
 Heisenberg.
 
 62
 00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,709
 Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
 we come across.
 
 63
 00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,115
 -Heisenberg?
 -Yeah, I know.
 
 64
 00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
 Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.
 
 65
 00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,039
 Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
 that big blue we keep finding.
 
 66
 00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,595
 Anyway, we'll stay on it.
 
 67
 00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,994
 Know why sharks are at the top
 of the food chain, Hank?
 
 68
 00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,312
 Because they have three sets of teeth
 and will take a bite out of anything?
 
 69
 00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,909
 Some of those suckers
 travel thousands of miles...
 
 70
 00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,111
 ...in pursuit of their prey.
 
 71
 00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,197
 Yeah, I think I heard that.
 
 72
 00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,194
 You, my friend, are a great white.
 
 73
 00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,192
 How does Albuquerque liaison...
 
 74
 00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,597
 ...Tri-State Border Interdiction
 Task Force sound?
 
 75
 00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,839
 Like one hell of a promotion.
 
 76
 00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,555
 As of the 1st, I want you to split
 your time between here and El Paso.
 
 77
 00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,069
 Thank you, sir. Thank you.
 
 78
 00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,238
 What you gonna do without me,
 Gomey?
 
 79
 00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,876
 Celebrate. I won't have to look
 at your ugly mug six days a week.
 
 80
 00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,753
 Hey, buddy,
 I am the brains and the brawn.
 
 81
 00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,269
 -I'm the whole package.
 -I'm glad I didn't just eat.
 
 82
 00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,835
 I'm surprised your head still fits
 through the door.
 
 83
 00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
 -You wanna grab lunch?
 -Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.
 
 84
 00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,439
 Done.
 I'll meet you morons downstairs.
 
 85
 00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,517
 Try not to get lost on the way.
 
 86
 00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,631
 Schrader.
 
 87
 00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,909
 Yeah. Hey, Ricky.
 
 88
 00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,634
 How you doing?
 Yeah, I'm stoked too.
 
 89
 00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,432
 Yeah, El Paso.
 
 90
 00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,834
 Here's the man.
 
 91
 00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,829
 -Hey, congratulations, Hank.
 -Thanks.
 
 92
 00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,153
 Gets two in the sand,
 two in the forest, you know?
 
 93
 00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,511
 And then he says,
 "Give me a four," you know?
 
 94
 00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,278
 Hey. Hey.
 
 95
 00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,630
 -Hey.
 -Got some nerve coming back here.
 
 96
 00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,671
 Or you're even dumber
 than I thought.
 
 97
 00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,916
 Yeah, well, maybe both.
 
 98
 00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,638
 Balance for the tow, the repairs...
 
 99
 00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,436
 ...and extra for damages and stuff,
 the gate...
 
 100
 00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,313
 ...the toilet.
 
 101
 00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,716
 Look, like I said...
 
 102
 00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,673
 ...my word is my bond.
 
 103
 00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,474
 What would you charge me
 to store this here?
 
 104
 00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,478
 -A million-five.
 -Come on, yo.
 
 105
 00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,796
 -Your sister.
 -Dog, I'm serious, all right?
 
 106
 00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,437
 I got storage needs.
 And I got scratch up front.
 
 107
 00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,949
 We could, you know, negotiate.
 
 108
 00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,189
 Five hundred.
 
 109
 00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,628
 -A month?
 -A week.
 
 110
 00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,439
 For real?
 
 111
 00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,198
 -See you.
 -Wait, wait, wait.
 
 112
 00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,516
 Just hold on. Just chill.
 
 113
 00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,033
 Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.
 
 114
 00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,231
 -Outside.
 -Inside.
 
 115
 00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,998
 -Forget it.
 -Man, come on.
 
 116
 00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,113
 Your fence is too easy to climb.
 
 117
 00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,754
 Inside, padlocked,
 plus gate privileges.
 
 118
 00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,748
 -Come again?
 -Gate, in and out, privileges.
 
 119
 00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,469
 Month to month. Cash up front.
 Inside.
 
 120
 00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,114
 And I don't know you.
 I don't know jack.
 
 121
 00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,548
 Yeah.
 
 122
 00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,590
 You selling?
 
 123
 00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,631
 I'll let you take it for nine Gs.
 
 124
 00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,117
 What about that one?
 
 125
 00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,359
 Serious?
 
 126
 00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,714
 It's Jane, right?
 
 127
 00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,230
 Well, Jane, I gotta say,
 this place is awesome.
 
 128
 00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,274
 -Really? Does it inspire awe?
 -No. I mean, you know, it's great.
 
 129
 00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,789
 Just what I've been looking for.
 That's what I meant.
 
 130
 00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,753
 I had an entire house before,
 detached and all...
 
 131
 00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,112
 ...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
 upkeep and whatnot. You know?
 
 132
 00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,198
 Well, the blinds are new.
 Everything's been painted.
 
 133
 00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,989
 Jesus.
 
 134
 00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,435
 Utilities are included.
 
 135
 00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,358
 Stacking. Sweet.
 
 136
 00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,154
 -You got cable?
 -Already wired. Just call to activate.
 
 137
 00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,918
 High speed, whatever.
 
 138
 00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,680
 Bathroom, cool tile.
 
 139
 00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,632
 Bedroom.
 
 140
 00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,909
 Nice.
 
 141
 00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,157
 I'm a fan of the hardwood.
 
 142
 00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,437
 -So you're interested?
 -Definitely. Definitely, yeah.
 
 143
 00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,517
 And you're good with NP, NS?
 
 144
 00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,115
 Sorry. What?
 
 145
 00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,357
 In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
 You wanna smoke, you do it outside.
 
 146
 00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,358
 No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
 It's cool. No worries.
 
 147
 00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,473
 All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
 or recent pay stub, current employer...
 
 148
 00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,148
 ...former address, you know,
 the yadda yadda.
 
 149
 00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,875
 And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.
 
 150
 00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,553
 Yeah. Look...
 
 151
 00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,159
 ...the thing is...
 
 152
 00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,918
 ...I can....
 
 153
 00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,519
 Unbelievable.
 
 154
 00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,190
 -I'm just currently between situations.
 -Then I'm currently not renting.
 
 155
 00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,870
 Look, look, I got the money and
 I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.
 
 156
 00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,390
 Come on, yo, can you please,
 please just help a brother out?
 
 157
 00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,068
 Yo, my dad's not really
 a make-exceptions kind of guy.
 
 158
 00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,350
 -Trust me.
 -Your dad?
 
 159
 00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,233
 Owns the place. I manage it.
 
 160
 00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,556
 Pen on paper. That's what I need.
 
 161
 00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,398
 Or go run your game
 somewhere else.
 
 162
 00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,716
 Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
 This is it.
 
 163
 00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,195
 And I got no game, all right?
 
 164
 00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,914
 I just need a chance.
 
 165
 00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,276
 Look, my folks, they kicked me out.
 
 166
 00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,313
 I'm a disappointment, apparently.
 
 167
 00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,273
 Didn't meet their expectations again.
 
 168
 00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,153
 So you know, now
 I'm persona non gratis or whatever.
 
 169
 00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,319
 But you know what?
 I'm a good person and I work hard.
 
 170
 00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,829
 I will pay you every month
 and I will pay you on time.
 
 171
 00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,873
 I will not mess this up, okay?
 I swear.
 
 172
 00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,629
 Rent just went up.
 
 173
 00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,515
 A hundred more a month.
 That's the cash price.
 
 174
 00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,199
 Yes.
 
 175
 00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,353
 Okay. Yes.
 
 176
 00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,154
 Hey, you rock. Thank you.
 Thank you. You won't regret this.
 
 177
 00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,954
 And in addition to first and last,
 I want two more months.
 
 178
 00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,515
 DBAA fee, non-refundable.
 
 179
 00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,077
 Yeah, of course. No problem.
 DBAA. Obviously, yeah.
 
 180
 00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,748
 All right. So, what's DBAA?
 
 181
 00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,190
 -Don't be an asshole.
 -Gotcha.
 
 182
 00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,834
 -I live next door.
 -Really?
 
 183
 00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,237
 Don't think for one second you have
 squatter's rights, because you don't.
 
 184
 00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,919
 If you blow this, I want you gone.
 
 185
 00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,078
 I know guys that'll have your skinny
 ass out back by the Dumpster...
 
 186
 00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,599
 ...faster than you can blink.
 
 187
 00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,951
 I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.
 
 188
 00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,388
 Which is what, by the way?
 
 189
 00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,795
 It's Jesse.
 
 190
 00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,635
 Jesse Jackson.
 
 191
 00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,715
 Seriously?
 
 192
 00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,475
 What?
 
 193
 00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,988
 -What are you doing?
 -Beating off. What's it look like?
 
 194
 00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,510
 That is in fact exactly
 what it looks like to me.
 
 195
 00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,678
 Brewing is an art form, Marie.
 I think you'd appreciate that by now.
 
 196
 00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,758
 Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.
 
 197
 00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,030
 So let me get this straight.
 
 198
 00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,631
 You call in sick the day after
 receiving a long-awaited...
 
 199
 00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,070
 ...career-boosting promotion...
 
 200
 00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,398
 ...so you can play Oktoberfest
 in your man cave?
 
 201
 00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,878
 I don't get it. Really, I don't.
 
 202
 00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,957
 Babe, relax.
 
 203
 00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,360
 -Please, don't tell me to relax.
 -Sorry, I forgot.
 
 204
 00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,471
 -You know I hate that.
 -Right.
 
 205
 00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,352
 Dave said I should express that.
 
 206
 00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,154
 All I'm saying is everything's fine.
 
 207
 00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,599
 I can take a day.
 
 208
 00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,438
 No big deal.
 
 209
 00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,397
 Now get that sweet ass out of here
 so I can concentrate.
 
 210
 00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,478
 ''Okay, so, what's the plan?''
 
 211
 00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,875
 The plan is we cook.
 
 212
 00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,312
 Why are we cooking when we can't
 even move what we cook?
 
 213
 00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,388
 Well, how much do you think
 you can sell on your own?
 
 214
 00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,194
 Say if I cook during the days
 and you work the nights.
 
 215
 00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,118
 -Dude.
 -What?
 
 216
 00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,035
 Prior to Tuco,
 that was your plan, wasn't it?
 
 217
 00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,516
 I understand it'll be a fraction
 of what we brought in before...
 
 218
 00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,792
 -...but still, what choice do we have?
 -First of all, there's no we.
 
 219
 00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,913
 Okay? You're talking me, solo,
 busting hump slinging shards.
 
 220
 00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,269
 I got profile now.
 
 221
 00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,552
 Don't you get that?
 DEA's up my ass.
 
 222
 00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,991
 No, I'm not exposing myself
 to that level of risk for chump change.
 
 223
 00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,634
 -No way.
 -Then what do you suggest?
 
 224
 00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,516
 I don't think either of us are eager
 to jump into bed with another Tuco.
 
 225
 00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,634
 I got bills, man.
 
 226
 00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,068
 You've got bills?
 
 227
 00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,032
 Rent, yo. Responsibilities.
 
 228
 00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,958
 I've already lost more than
 I've made...
 
 229
 00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,720
 ...and I am tired
 of dicking around out here.
 
 230
 00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,832
 You wanna know how much
 I've got left?
 
 231
 00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,031
 After completing
 my first round of treatment...
 
 232
 00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,596
 ...and financing
 the world's most expensive alibi?
 
 233
 00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,677
 Zero. Zip. Nothing.
 
 234
 00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,838
 I've got nothing to show for all of this.
 Nothing for my family...
 
 235
 00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,316
 ...which, as you might remember,
 was the whole damn point.
 
 236
 00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,515
 But seeing as throwing in the towel
 is not an option...
 
 237
 00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,632
 ...that leaves us with a total
 of two choices.
 
 238
 00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,752
 We go into business
 with yet another homicidal lunatic...
 
 239
 00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,916
 ...or you and I start—240
 00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,715
 You selling whatever you can.
 
 241
 00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,511
 There's a third way.
 
 242
 00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,758
 And what would that be?
 
 243
 00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,472
 We got to be Tuco.
 
 244
 00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,955
 All right? Cut out the middleman.
 Run our own game.
 
 245
 00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,835
 So you're going to what?
 
 246
 00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,110
 Snort meth off a bowie knife?
 
 247
 00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,232
 You gonna beat your homeys to death
 when they "dis" you?
 
 248
 00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,797
 Look, I know some guys.
 All right? I can create a network.
 
 249
 00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,709
 Look, we control production
 and distribution.
 
 250
 00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,992
 That way, we stay off the front lines
 while moving some serious glass.
 
 251
 00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,112
 I mean, the point here is
 to make money, right?
 
 252
 00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,548
 Sky-high stacks.
 
 253
 00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,238
 -No.
 -No? That's not the point?
 
 254
 00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,908
 No, I am not willing to do that.
 
 255
 00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,631
 Who said anything about you?
 
 256
 00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,591
 I don't vote for this plan.
 
 257
 00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,793
 I'm not comfortable bringing in
 unknown entities into our operation.
 
 258
 00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,434
 Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.
 
 259
 00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,996
 I beg your pardon?
 
 260
 00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,829
 -This is a partnership, remember?
 -I rem—Oh, I remember.
 
 261
 00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,076
 Yeah, you cook, I sell.
 
 262
 00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,431
 That was the division of labour
 when we started all this.
 
 263
 00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,710
 And that's exactly
 how we should have kept it.
 
 264
 00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,639
 Because I sure as hell didn't
 find myself locked in a trunk...
 
 265
 00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,956
 ...or on my knees
 with a gun to my head...
 
 266
 00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,993
 ...before your greedy old ass
 came along. All right?
 
 267
 00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,917
 All right, I will admit
 to a bit of a learning curve.
 
 268
 00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,908
 And perhaps
 I was overly ambitious.
 
 269
 00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,029
 In any case, it's not gonna happen
 that way anymore.
 
 270
 00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,832
 Yeah, damn straight.
 
 271
 00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,951
 Know why?
 
 272
 00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,833
 Because we do things
 my way this time...
 
 273
 00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,792
 ...or I walk.
 
 274
 00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,312
 You need me more than
 I need you, Walt.
 
 275
 00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,039
 Yo, enter my ''casa.''
 Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?
 
 276
 00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,195
 What up with it, yo?
 
 277
 00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,517
 Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
 Welcome to my humble abode.
 
 278
 00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,359
 Good deal, mover. Good deal.
 
 279
 00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,359
 -Yo, Badge, hey.
 -Cool crib, man.
 
 280
 00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,118
 Hey, it echoes.
 
 281
 00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,878
 Hello.
 
 282
 00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,957
 Hello. Hello, hello, hello.
 
 283
 00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,798
 Let me give you the virtual tour,
 okay?
 
 284
 00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,434
 So plasma is gonna go right here.
 
 285
 00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,596
 Probably like 50-inch,
 you know, wall-mounted.
 
 286
 00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,916
 Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.
 
 287
 00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,712
 No. They burn in, yo.
 
 288
 00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,912
 But the picture's, like, way sharper.
 Blacks are deeper too.
 
 289
 00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,588
 They got 3-D coming out,
 like, any day now.
 
 290
 00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,392
 That's what I'm waiting for.
 
 291
 00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,716
 -Porn, coz. You know?
 -Jesus.
 
 292
 00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,309
 Like 3-D tatas,
 like right in your face.
 
 293
 00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,273
 Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
 of those zero-gravity chairs...
 
 294
 00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,199
 ...for, like, right here,
 for your ultimate viewing comfort.
 
 295
 00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,469
 Those are buck.
 
 296
 00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,558
 It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
 Very Asiany, modern stuff.
 
 297
 00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,796
 -Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
 -Yeah.
 
 298
 00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,116
 I'm thinking, you know,
 just a bunch of candles...
 
 299
 00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,629
 ...maybe one of those
 little fountain jobs right here.
 
 300
 00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,558
 -It's gonna be chill.
 -The ladies...
 
 301
 00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,355
 ...they cream up real nice for,
 like, candles and shit.
 
 302
 00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,549
 You are going to score, big time.
 
 303
 00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,037
 All right, so how about we get,
 you know, down to it?
 
 304
 00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,232
 There's some refreshments over here
 if you wanna partake.
 
 305
 00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,910
 You got any other refreshments?
 
 306
 00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,873
 -I could kick it. It's been a while.
 -Yes, yes.
 
 307
 00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,389
 I could totally go
 for a loving spoonful.
 
 308
 00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,750
 No, no, no.
 No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?
 
 309
 00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,430
 You smoke it up on your own time.
 We're talking business here.
 
 310
 00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,151
 Okay? So listen up.
 
 311
 00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,875
 This is how it goes.
 I front each of you an ounce.
 
 312
 00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,834
 You sell it for 2,500.
 I keep the two, you keep the five.
 
 313
 00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,679
 No cutting it.
 You sell it as is, all right?
 
 314
 00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,235
 Twenty-five hundred an ounce?
 
 315
 00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,873
 That's kind of hopeful, bro.
 
 316
 00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,390
 -Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
 -Seventeen.
 
 317
 00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,149
 Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.
 
 318
 00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,636
 All right? Everybody and their mother's
 gonna want a taste. And second...
 
 319
 00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,831
 ...who else is selling right now,
 huh?
 
 320
 00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,952
 -It's dry out there, that's for sure.
 -Church.
 
 321
 00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,277
 So you point it how you want, okay?
 Quarter, half, teener, whatever.
 
 322
 00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,517
 But I make what I make.
 Two large. No exceptions.
 
 323
 00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,836
 Short me, you're out.
 
 324
 00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,553
 Cut it, you're out.
 
 325
 00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,318
 Period.
 
 326
 00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,274
 This is a big opportunity
 I am giving you.
 
 327
 00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,959
 Understand?
 
 328
 00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,674
 Badger, what is this?
 
 329
 00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,313
 A big opportunity.
 
 330
 00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,830
 Exactly. All right?
 This is the ground floor.
 
 331
 00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,396
 Gentlemen,
 how far you go is up to you.
 
 332
 00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,999
 So bring out the product, yo.
 
 333
 00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,839
 No, no, no. Not here, all right?
 Not ever.
 
 334
 00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,828
 Blind drop. I will let you know
 when and where.
 
 335
 00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,438
 All right?
 So you'll be hearing from me.
 
 336
 00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,358
 Now, I got mad volume.
 
 337
 00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,075
 So you move it quick,
 you move it right...
 
 338
 00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,272
 ...there is always more.
 
 339
 00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,797
 Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?
 
 340
 00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,116
 Apply yourselves.
 
 341
 00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,355
 Hell, yeah.
 
 342
 00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,477
 Hell, yeah.
 
 343
 00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,549
 Hey, there's the big guy.
 
 344
 00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,910
 -Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
 -Hey, Hank.
 
 345
 00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,235
 It's an armpit.
 
 346
 00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,112
 It's not an armpit.
 
 347
 00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,878
 Oh, excuse me.
 
 348
 00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,514
 You're right.
 It's the Paris of the Southwest.
 
 349
 00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,995
 Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.
 
 350
 00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,431
 Right on the border
 of lawless Mexican hell.
 
 351
 00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,631
 Human heads, they leave.
 
 352
 00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,753
 The cartels, they litter the place
 with human heads.
 
 353
 00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,235
 Yeah, well, pretty sure
 that's why I'm going there.
 
 354
 00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,874
 It's like a calling card
 or a shoutout or something.
 
 355
 00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,833
 Now, D.C., on the other hand,
 I could get behind.
 
 356
 00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,554
 You just do your time
 like a good boy...
 
 357
 00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,593
 ...and I could see us
 in a cute little condo in Georgetown...
 
 358
 00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,472
 ...in a couple of years.
 
 359
 00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,908
 I went online to this fantastic...
 
 360
 00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,918
 ...real estate website for D.C.
 
 361
 00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,716
 There's just so much,
 I don't know, culture there.
 
 362
 00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,876
 I was talking to Melinda,
 Hank's boss's wife.
 
 363
 00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,992
 I told you about the one with
 helmet hair and permanent lip liner.
 
 364
 00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,316
 Anyway, she was saying that
 when they were there—365
 00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,393
 Apologise.
 
 366
 00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,999
 What?
 
 367
 00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,389
 I will not listen to one more word
 until you apologise.
 
 368
 00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,959
 -For?
 -You know perfectly well, Marie.
 
 369
 00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,038
 -Well, obviously I don't--
 -Your lies.
 
 370
 00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,753
 To me.
 
 371
 00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,156
 The shoplifting.
 
 372
 00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,873
 All of it.
 
 373
 00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,358
 Did you really think it was all just
 neatly gonna go away?
 
 374
 00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,518
 Well, if you hadn't tried to return it—375
 00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,473
 Apologise.
 
 376
 00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,756
 Now or never. I mean it.
 
 377
 00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,315
 Or it'll never be the same.
 
 378
 00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,869
 Why are you punishing me?
 
 379
 00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,870
 If you don't respect me enough to
 apologise, to tell me the truth, then—380
 00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,357
 I need my sister back.
 
 381
 00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,398
 I'm sorry.
 
 382
 00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,512
 I'm sorry.
 
 383
 00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,111
 -What, do you want the gory details?
 -Yeah. Oh, yeah.
 
 384
 00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,038
 No, you don't.
 
 385
 00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,037
 Keep you up at night.
 
 386
 00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,670
 So was it scary?
 
 387
 00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,314
 Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
 you little punk.
 
 388
 00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,509
 Jesus.
 
 389
 00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,473
 But you were way faster than him.
 
 390
 00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,958
 Well, I'm here, aren't I?
 
 391
 00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,751
 Yeah. Hell, yeah.
 
 392
 00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,234
 Kick ass and take names.
 
 393
 00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,113
 -Son.
 -No, it's fine.
 
 394
 00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,037
 You know what it is?
 
 395
 00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,755
 A cockroach comes out
 from under a fridge, what do you do?
 
 396
 00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,791
 I mean, you don't think about it.
 
 397
 00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,550
 You stomp them down.
 
 398
 00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,593
 Where do they come from?
 
 399
 00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,508
 Criminals, like the one you....
 
 400
 00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,269
 I mean, what do you think it is
 that makes them who they are?
 
 401
 00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,753
 Buddy, you might as well be
 asking me about the roaches.
 
 402
 00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,951
 All I know is there's a whole world
 of them out there.
 
 403
 00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,319
 Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.
 
 404
 00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,755
 Cops.
 
 405
 00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,958
 Cops!
 
 406
 00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,556
 Wasn't sure it was you.
 
 407
 00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,714
 New car?
 
 408
 00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,549
 Yeah, keeping things on the DL.
 
 409
 00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,752
 I'm guessing
 this one doesn't bounce.
 
 410
 00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,511
 Your half.
 
 411
 00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,075
 Fifteen K.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 
 412
 00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,119
 You're welcome.
 
 413
 00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,309
 Jesus.
 
 414
 00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,796
 Help me understand the math,
 okay?
 
 415
 00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,797
 I gave you 1 pound, correct?
 
 416
 00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,798
 You and I split $2,000 per ounce.
 
 417
 00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,718
 $1,000 each.
 
 418
 00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,751
 One pound, that's 16 ounces.
 
 419
 00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,590
 Sixteen ounces should net
 to me $16,000.
 
 420
 00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,633
 Sixteen. Not 15.
 
 421
 00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,519
 Something came up.
 
 422
 00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,234
 Something came up?
 
 423
 00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,398
 One of my guys got held up
 by a couple junkies.
 
 424
 00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,991
 Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
 Skinny Pete's cool.
 
 425
 00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,553
 So you're saying
 that your guy got robbed—426
 00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
 Or rather you got robbed.
 --but it doesn't matter.
 
 427
 00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,433
 Dude, it's called breakage, okay?
 
 428
 00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,278
 Like Kmart. Shit breaks.
 
 429
 00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,357
 And you're thinking
 this is acceptable?
 
 430
 00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,518
 It's the cost of business, yo.
 
 431
 00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,119
 You're sweating me over a grand?
 
 432
 00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,552
 Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
 I'm not the street guy, yo.
 
 433
 00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,910
 But it seems to me
 that what you call breakage...
 
 434
 00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,078
 ...is just you making a fool
 of yourself.
 
 435
 00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,996
 I've got another technical
 term for you.
 
 436
 00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,830
 Non-sustainable business model.
 
 437
 00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,190
 You're focusing on the negative.
 
 438
 00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,836
 Six grand a day we're making.
 What's your problem?
 
 439
 00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,751
 What happens when
 word gets out...
 
 440
 00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,236
 ...and it's open season
 on these clowns you've hired?
 
 441
 00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,238
 Once everyone knows that
 Jesse Pinkman...
 
 442
 00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,353
 ...drug lord,
 can be robbed with impunity.
 
 443
 00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,788
 Man, come on.
 
 444
 00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,310
 You think Tuco had breakage?
 
 445
 00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,032
 I guess it's true, he did.
 
 446
 00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,309
 He broke bones.
 
 447
 00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,317
 He broke the skull of anybody
 who tried to rip him off.
 
 448
 00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,909
 You want another grand?
 Is that it?
 
 449
 00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,270
 -That's not my point.
 -Take it. Here.
 
 450
 00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,758
 Look, you got 15,000
 you didn't have yesterday.
 
 451
 00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,030
 Hey, we're making bank.
 Shit happens.
 
 452
 00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,754
 My guys get what they're up against
 and they're careful.
 
 453
 00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,234
 So am I.
 
 454
 00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,034
 And you're all tucked in at night
 with your precious family.
 
 455
 00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,993
 So why don't you just stop being
 such a freak about everything?
 
 456
 00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,953
 You've made
 the division of labour very clear.
 
 457
 00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,636
 Yo, I mean, seriously...
 
 458
 00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,196
 ...what the hell
 do you want me to do, huh?
 
 459
 00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,275
 Hey.
 
 460
 00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,674
 Sorry.
 
 461
 00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,552
 Wow, you snuck in.
 
 462
 00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,751
 Didn't even know you were home.
 
 463
 00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,989
 What you eating?
 
 464
 00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,112
 A panini. There's another one
 in the freezer if you want it.
 
 465
 00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,918
 I thought we nixed those, huh?
 
 466
 00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,758
 Did we?
 
 467
 00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,191
 Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
 with the off-the-chart sodium?
 
 468
 00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,792
 I had a craving.
 
 469
 00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,070
 Once in a while is no big deal.
 
 470
 00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,473
 So where's Jr.?
 
 471
 00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,554
 Out.
 
 472
 00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,956
 With whom?
 
 473
 00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,559
 Louis.
 
 474
 00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,396
 Out where?
 
 475
 00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,638
 Somewhere. I don't know.
 
 476
 00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,513
 -He'll be back by 9.
 -Okay.
 
 477
 00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,835
 Yeah, I just thought you might
 have a clue where your son is.
 
 478
 00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,553
 Why don't you?
 
 479
 00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,839
 Why am I the only one who needs
 to keep track of our son?
 
 480
 00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,349
 I'll tell you what.
 Wanna know where he is, ask him.
 
 481
 00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,710
 Just pick up the phone like I do.
 
 482
 00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,319
 Great.
 
 483
 00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,992
 Perhaps you might know
 something...
 
 484
 00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,315
 ...about this.
 
 485
 00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,035
 Perhaps.
 
 486
 00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,949
 And then again...
 
 487
 00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,076
 ...perhaps I don't, Walt.
 
 488
 00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,590
 Perhaps I smoked them
 in a fugue state.
 
 489
 00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,477
 I'd like an explanation, please.
 
 490
 00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,433
 -You don't wanna go down that road.
 -Why would you do this?
 
 491
 00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,552
 -You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
 -Three and a half cigarettes...
 
 492
 00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,159
 ...won't do a thing to the baby.
 
 493
 00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,396
 -Nothing.
 -I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.
 
 494
 00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,068

 502
 00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,711
 Yo.
 
 503
 00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,911
