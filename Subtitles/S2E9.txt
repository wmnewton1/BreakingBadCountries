==Subtitles==

 1
 00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,277
 These people.
 
 2
 00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,795
 Pathetic.
 
 3
 00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,796
 I already read that one anyway.
 
 4
 00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,877
 Kleinman has better magazines.
 
 5
 00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,152
 You know, you guys
 really don't need to hang around.
 
 6
 00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,669
 We won't even get the results
 till next week.
 
 7
 00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,348
 Buddy, we're gonna be here.
 You kidding me?
 
 8
 00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,154
 It is a full PET''I''CT, correct?
 
 9
 00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,273
 You definitely want the PET''I''CT
 and not just the PET.
 
 10
 00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,790
 Yeah, it's a PET''I''CT.
 
 11
 00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,355
 Good. That's what you want.
 
 12
 00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,757
 Some places skimp
 and they only do the PET.
 
 13
 00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,675
 I'm not naming any names.
 
 14
 00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,758
 I just still don't understand
 why you don't go to Kleinman.
 
 15
 00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,552
 This is where Walt's doctor is.
 
 16
 00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
 Well, with us, you wouldn't
 have to wait until next week...
 
 17
 00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,192
 ...to get the results.
 
 18
 00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,233
 I'm sorry, but these scans
 are not that difficult to read.
 
 19
 00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,953
 I could take one look at Walt's...
 
 20
 00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,396
 ...and tell you immediately
 how he's doing.
 
 21
 00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,273
 -Really.
 -Doctors like people to think...
 
 22
 00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,790
 ...that they're so much smarter
 than the technicians...
 
 23
 00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,959
 ...but you would be surprised
 how much they come to us for input.
 
 24
 00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,159
 Well, never turn down a chance
 to hit the bathroom, huh?
 
 25
 00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,318
 Excuse me.
 
 26
 00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,918
 You all right in there?
 
 27
 00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,833
 Yeah.
 
 28
 00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,998
 Hey, you okay?
 
 29
 00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,633
 Yes.
 
 30
 00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,876
 I'm fine, thank you.
 
 31
 00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,118
 Sir, you can go back to your
 changing room and get dressed.
 
 32
 00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,155
 -So how'd we do?
 -You did fine.
 
 33
 00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,278
 -See anything?
 -I'm just a technician, Mr. White.
 
 34
 00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,199
 Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
 with you next week.
 
 35
 00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,753
 Sorry.
 
 36
 00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,876
 Actually, the money-laundering aspect
 is fairly straightforward.
 
 37
 00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,516
 But I gotta tell you,
 the not-telling-your-wife aspect?
 
 38
 00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
 Most people wanna know
 why they suddenly got rich.
 
 39
 00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,268
 If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.
 
 40
 00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,391
 How much time they giving you?
 
 41
 00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,833
 Weeks.
 
 42
 00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,553
 Maybe.
 
 43
 00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,159
 Sorry to hear it.
 
 44
 00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,830
 I was hoping we could
 make some real money together.
 
 45
 00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,715
 Oh, well.
 Look, let's crunch some numbers.
 
 46
 00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,514
 How much money
 are we laundering?
 
 47
 00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,678
 At this time, $16,000.
 
 48
 00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,953
 How long you been doing this?
 
 49
 00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,309
 We've had some
 extenuating circumstances.
 
 50
 00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,919
 Yeah, apparently.
 
 51
 00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,240
 All right, 16,000 laundered
 at 75 cents on the dollar...
 
 52
 00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,830
 ...minus my fee,
 which is 17 percent...
 
 53
 00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,077
 ...comes to $9960.
 
 54
 00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,750
 Congratulations, you just left
 your family a secondhand Subaru.
 
 55
 00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,350
 Well, we'll just have to cook more.
 A lot more.
 
 56
 00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,835
 Yeah, that's my legal opinion.
 
 57
 00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,157
 Make hay
 while the sun is still shining.
 
 58
 00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,077
 You know, we should do something
 this weekend.
 
 59
 00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,431
 You know,
 get our minds off the test results.
 
 60
 00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,951
 Actually, I....
 
 61
 00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,393
 I'm thinking I should go see Mom.
 
 62
 00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,271
 -Really?
 -Yeah.
 
 63
 00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,758
 You know, I never did call her.
 
 64
 00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,636
 You're expecting the news
 from the scan to be bad.
 
 65
 00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,118
 God, Walt.
 
 66
 00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,037
 I need you to stay positive
 with me here.
 
 67
 00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,471
 I am. Positive is good.
 
 68
 00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,829
 I'm all for positive...
 
 69
 00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,318
 ...but positive doesn't change facts,
 all right?
 
 70
 00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,839
 It....
 
 71
 00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,788
 It doesn't change the need
 to be prepared.
 
 72
 00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,319
 I know.
 
 73
 00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,751
 Walt, I'm just trying
 to be hopeful, okay?
 
 74
 00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,951
 You know, forgive me.
 
 75
 00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,113
 Look...
 
 76
 00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,118
 ...I need to know Mom's
 going to leave you something ifâ€”77
 00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,833
 If...
 
 78
 00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,948
 ...I'm no longer around.
 
 79
 00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,232
 I just need to get that straight,
 that's all.
 
 80
 00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,509
 And believe me,
 I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.
 
 81
 00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,430
 Complaining about her nurses
 the entire time.
 
 82
 00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,199
 "Juanita is hiding my ashtray."
 
 83
 00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,757
 A 30-minute discourse...
 
 84
 00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,270
 ...about how the sugar packets
 are suddenly disappearing.
 
 85
 00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,631
 And, oh, she's counting
 every one of them, you know.
 
 86
 00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,871
 I'll be lucky
 if I get a word in edgewise.
 
 87
 00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,915
 I actually think the news from the scan
 is gonna be good.
 
 88
 00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,278
 Perhaps you should prepare for that.
 
 89
 00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,439
 Yeah.
 
 90
 00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,959
 -We should do something.
 -Yeah, we should.
 
 91
 00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,515
 No, something else.
 
 92
 00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,391
 We should go somewhere.
 
 93
 00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,271
 Have you been
 to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?
 
 94
 00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,516
 Is that the one with the A-bombs?
 
 95
 00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,076
 Georgia O'Keeffe.
 
 96
 00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,111
 She's a painter.
 
 97
 00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,591
 You've never heard
 of Georgia O'Keeffe?
 
 98
 00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,597
 No, is that bad?
 
 99
 00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,351
 -Boy, you need some educating.
 -Yes, yes, I do. Come here.
 
 100
 00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,552
 Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
 We'll make a day of it.
 
 101
 00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,196
 You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
 for a museum?
 
 102
 00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,868
 So romantic.
 
 103
 00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,640
 Yup, we're going. Get up.
 
 104
 00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,473
 Why can't we just go to the movies
 or putt-putt?
 
 105
 00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,875
 It's the shit.
 
 106
 00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,077
 A little culture won't kill you.
 
 107
 00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,716
 Besides, you might like it.
 A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.
 
 108
 00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,115
 Really?
 
 109
 00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,188
 -Is there still cereal?
 -Yeah.
 
 110
 00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,913
 ''Yo, if I know you, leave a message.''
 
 111
 00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,759
 ''Where the hell are you?''
 ''Pick up the phone.''
 
 112
 00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,032
 ''-Hello? Jesse, pick up--''
 -Hold on, hold on.
 
 113
 00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,196
 Sorry, one sec.
 
 114
 00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,628
 -What?
 ''-I've been trying to reach you.''
 
 115
 00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,955
 Where's your drop phone?
 
 116
 00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,554
 -I've been busy.
 ''-Well, clear your social calendar.''
 
 117
 00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,150
 -We have to cook.
 ''-What? Today?''
 
 118
 00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,669
 ''No, you'll need today at least''
 ''to gather supplies.''
 
 119
 00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,030
 ''Now, we're going to need''
 ''all new glassware...''
 
 120
 00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,629
 ...heating mantles,
 about a hundred pounds of ice.
 
 121
 00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,593
 Do you have a paper and pencil?
 You should be writing this down.
 
 122
 00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,633
 You wanna go shopping,
 go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.
 
 123
 00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,479
 ''Smoking marijuana,''
 ''eating Cheetos and masturbating...''
 
 124
 00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,069
 ...do not constitute plans
 in my book.
 
 125
 00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,271
 ''Well, screw you and your book, man,''
 ''all right?''
 
 126
 00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,313
 I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
 not like you need to know.
 
 127
 00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,559
 -You're going to a museum, huh?
 -Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.
 
 128
 00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,672
 -Georgia O'Keeffe?
 ''-She's a painter, duh.''
 
 129
 00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,279
 She does these vagina pictures.
 
 130
 00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,472
 Or paintings, or just painted.
 I don't know.
 
 131
 00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,033
 What are you even talking about?
 
 132
 00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,277
 Look, man, why am I even
 explaining myself to you, all right?
 
 133
 00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,471
 It's none of your damn business
 what I'm doing.
 
 134
 00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,877
 All you need to know is I ain't cooking
 or shopping or whatever the hell.
 
 135
 00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,479
 Let me explain something to you.
 
 136
 00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,592
 You and I need to cook
 through to next Tuesday.
 
 137
 00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,839
 -Tuesday? Four days straight?
 -Like it or not, we have no choice.
 
 138
 00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,191
 ''Yeah? And why exactly is that?''
 
 139
 00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,196
 Our methylamine. It's going bad.
 
 140
 00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,550
 -What?
 -''It's losing its chemical potency.''
 
 141
 00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,752
 Now, unless stealing another barrel
 sounds good to you....
 
 142
 00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,188
 ''Hell, no.''
 
 143
 00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,914
 All right, we have to act fast,
 before it goes to waste.
 
 144
 00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,236
 ''You have a paper and pencil?''
 
 145
 00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,309
 ''-Come on.''
 -All right, all right. Go.
 
 146
 00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,274
 Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?
 
 147
 00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,596
 What do you mean, mantle?
 You mean like Mickey?
 
 148
 00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,756
 I really wish
 you didn't have to do this.
 
 149
 00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,272
 Me too.
 
 150
 00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,152
 But I'll be back before you know it...
 
 151
 00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,954
 ...and you can always call
 if you need me.
 
 152
 00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,551
 What, and risk talking to your mother?
 Have to be some emergency.
 
 153
 00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,993
 Love you.
 
 154
 00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
 -Fly safe, okay?
 -Okay.
 
 155
 00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,108
 ''The white zone is for immediate''
 ''loading and unloading...''
 
 156
 00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,639
 ''...of passengers only.''
 
 157
 00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,637
 ''No parking.''
 
 158
 00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,558
 ''Attention, passengers.:''
 ''Please maintain visual contact...''
 
 159
 00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,990
 ''...with your personal belongings''
 ''at all times.''
 
 160
 00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,509
 ''Any bags left unattended''
 ''will be confiscated...''
 
 161
 00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,597
 ''...by airport personnel.''
 
 162
 00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,754
 You brought a meth lab
 to the airport?
 
 163
 00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,474
 What? You said we were in a hurry.
 I saved us a trip.
 
 164
 00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,750
 Yeah. Did you get everything?
 All six?
 
 165
 00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,190
 -Yeah.
 -With reflux condensers?
 
 166
 00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,913
 Yes. Like I said, yes.
 
 167
 00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,591
 -Just go. Drive. Go, go.
 -Okay.
 
 168
 00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,679
 Good morning to you too, man.
 
 169
 00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,031
 -Stupid--
 -Three entire bags of Funyuns?
 
 170
 00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,470
 What? Funyuns are awesome.
 
 171
 00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,636
 -God.
 -Hey, more for me.
 
 172
 00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,593
 How about something
 with some protein maybe?
 
 173
 00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,995
 Something green, huh?
 
 174
 00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,432
 Man, I'm getting no service.
 
 175
 00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,915
 How are you even alive?
 
 176
 00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,355
 Hey, yo, check your phone.
 You get any bars?
 
 177
 00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,198
 Yeah, I've got a signal.
 
 178
 00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,669
 -Hey, let me use yours, would you?
 -Absolutely not.
 
 179
 00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,950
 I have to assume
 Skyler checks my phone records.
 
 180
 00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,116
 -You know that.
 -It's not business, all right?
 
 181
 00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,548
 -It's personal.
 -Oh, personal.
 
 182
 00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,433
 -What, female?
 -Maybe.
 
 183
 00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,392
 Absolutely. That's all I need.
 
 184
 00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,795
 Skyler hits redial
 and some stripper answers.
 
 185
 00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,549
 Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
 Dickwad.
 
 186
 00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,429
 Sorry. My wife checks.
 
 187
 00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,432
 -Drinking water?
 -Yup.
 
 188
 00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,232
 Is that all we've got?
 
 189
 00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,194
 Ten gallons?
 What, you plan on taking a bath in it?
 
 190
 00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,068
 Oh, God.
 
 191
 00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,515
 No, not there.
 That is our workstation.
 
 192
 00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,871
 -Oh, our "workstation."
 -That's right.
 
 193
 00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,116
 Why don't you try to find a place
 where it won't get lost?
 
 194
 00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,799
 Considering it's our only set...
 
 195
 00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,833
 ...and we are a million miles
 from nowhere.
 
 196
 00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,637
 Why don't you try
 sticking them up your ass sideways?
 
 197
 00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,630
 Two-point-three-five pounds.
 
 198
 00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,479
 Two-point-three-five.
 
 199
 00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,272
 That's the last of it.
 
 200
 00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,030
 -How many total?
 -Nineteen.
 
 201
 00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,120
 So dollar-wise?
 
 202
 00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,878
 How much?
 
 203
 00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,072
 Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...
 
 204
 00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,831
 ...that's 41.8,
 call that 42 pounds, at....
 
 205
 00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,315
 -What are we selling for these days?
 -Forty a pound.
 
 206
 00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,193
 -Forty thousand dollars?
 -Hey, you said raise the prices.
 
 207
 00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,153
 All right, that's 40 times 42...
 
 208
 00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,272
 ...minus distribution charges....
 
 209
 00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,555
 What?
 
 210
 00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,348
 What?
 
 211
 00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,310
 Six hundred seventy-two
 thousand dollars.
 
 212
 00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,034
 -All in?
 -No.
 
 213
 00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,759
 Each.
 
 214
 00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,315
 Each?
 
 215
 00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,035
 -Each.
 -Six hundred and--?
 
 216
 00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,595
 Seventy-two thousand dollars each.
 
 217
 00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,110
 Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!
 
 218
 00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,836
 Hey, come high, baby.
 Come on. Yes. Come on.
 
 219
 00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,718
 Yes! Yes!
 
 220
 00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,318
 Well, there goes the generator.
 
 221
 00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,750
 I think that's it for the gas.
 
 222
 00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,393
 Perfect timing, yo.
 
 223
 00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,353
 -How do you figure that?
 -What do you mean?
 
 224
 00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,515
 We're done cooking.
 
 225
 00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,518
 I am not done
 until this barrel is empty.
 
 226
 00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,835
 Look at this.
 
 227
 00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,157
 I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
 of methylamine.
 
 228
 00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,352
 -Come on, where's your ambition?
 -Jesus. Seriously?
 
 229
 00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,755
 We are way ahead of schedule, man,
 all right?
 
 230
 00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,793
 Plus the genny needs gas,
 we're almost out of propane...
 
 231
 00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,798
 ...and my back is killing me
 from that piece-of-crap cot.
 
 232
 00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,468
 Come on, can we at least
 just take the night off?
 
 233
 00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,114
 Look, I don't have to take you back
 till Tuesday, right?
 
 234
 00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,754
 So we come back tomorrow,
 strap on the sizzle...
 
 235
 00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,393
 ...and glass up the rest.
 
 236
 00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,555
 Come on.
 
 237
 00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,513
 There's gotta be a Denny's
 out there someplace.
 
 238
 00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,312
 Grand Slam?
 
 239
 00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,590
 Hot shower?
 
 240
 00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,869
 A bed?
 
 241
 00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,234
 -Separate rooms.
 -Yeah, that's a given.
 
 242
 00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,632
 What the hell?
 
 243
 00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,238
 What the...? The battery's dead.
 
 244
 00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,713
 Jesse, back when I asked you
 to put the keys in a safe place...
 
 245
 00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,474
 ...where did you put them?
 
 246
 00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,231
 -I left them right here in the ignition.
 -Son of a bitch.
 
 247
 00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,510
 Whoa, whoa, no,
 this is not my fault, all right?
 
 248
 00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,199
 -The buzzer didn't buzz.
 -The what?
 
 249
 00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,550
 The buzzer that buzzes
 when you put the keys in...
 
 250
 00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,318
 ...to let you know the battery's on.
 
 251
 00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,112
 I know that. It didn't buzz.
 
 252
 00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,515
 Look, I didn't turn the key
 or anything, all right?
 
 253
 00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,518
 I'm not stupid.
 Did you hear the buzzer buzz?
 
 254
 00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,756
 I did not. It's faulty.
 It's a faulty mechanism.
 
 255
 00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,474
 Is this just a genetic thing with you?
 Is it congenital?
 
 256
 00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,194
 Did your mother drop you
 on your head when you were a baby?
 
 257
 00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,435
 The buzzer did not buzz.
 
 258
 00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,710
 And you're the one
 that made me move the keys.
 
 259
 00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,478
 Yes, I see your point.
 
 260
 00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,194
 Your imbecility being what it is,
 I should've known to say:
 
 261
 00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,472
 "Jesse, don't leave the keys
 in the ignition the entire two days."
 
 262
 00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,194
 I wanted to leave them
 on the counter, bitch.
 
 263
 00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,675
 Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.
 
 264
 00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,711
 -Jesus.
 -Okay, just....
 
 265
 00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,519
 All right, so we need
 to jump the battery somehow.
 
 266
 00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,278
 Okay.
 
 267
 00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,629
 How?
 
 268
 00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,550
 You gonna be okay?
 
 269
 00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,837
 Oh, damn it.
 
 270
 00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,078
 What's it taste like?
 
 271
 00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,669
 Bad, huh?
 
 272
 00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,796
 This is good.
 This is good. Right here.
 
 273
 00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,912
 Okay. There.
 
 274
 00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,714
 Here. Red to red, black to black.
 
 275
 00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,950
 Positive, negative.
 All right. Start it up.
 
 276
 00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,590
 What the hell's wrong
 with this thing?
 
 277
 00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,598
 -You have to really pull.
 -I am.
 
 278
 00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,518
 No, really pull, not like a girl.
 
 279
 00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,280
 You know what? Pull this.
 I am pulling.
 
 280
 00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,798
 It just needs to warm up a little.
 All right.
 
 281
 00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,149
 Oh, my God.
 
 282
 00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,352
 Oh, jeez.
 
 283
 00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,195
 Well done, Jesse, as always. Just....
 
 284
 00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,913
 Well done.
 
 285
 00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,919
 God.
 
 286
 00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,876
 Come on, you bitches.
 
 287
 00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,071
 Hear me now.
 
 288
 00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,511
 Damn it.
 
 289
 00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,992
 Stupid.
 
 290
 00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,070
 Okay, now we have to use
 your phone.
 
 291
 00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,316
 This is ruined. Do you understand?
 Just ruined.
 
 292
 00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,438
 You hooked it up wrong
 and blew it up.
 
 293
 00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,279
 No, no, no.
 That is not what happened.
 
 294
 00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,549
 How do you know?
 
 295
 00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,991
 What I know is that I wasn't the one
 who dumped out the last of our water.
 
 296
 00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,872
 -That's what I know.
 -There was a fire.
 
 297
 00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,832
 Excuse me for thinking on my feet.
 
 298
 00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,031
 Is that what you were--?
 You were thinking?
 
 299
 00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,992
 Now that we have
 identified the problemâ€”300
 00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,316
 You and thinking,
 that's the problem.
 
 301
 00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,355
 Look, somebody is going to
 have to pick us up, all right?
 
 302
 00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,710
 Your wife is not gonna notice
 one little call.
 
 303
 00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,436
 Mr. White, come on.
 
 304
 00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,035
 God.
 
 305
 00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,109
 All right, look, just make it snappy.
 
 306
 00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,278
 -Roaming drains the battery.
 -All right.
 
 307
 00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,072
 Yo, Skinny, hey.
 
 308
 00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,317
 Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
 I need you to come pick us up.
 
 309
 00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,798
 Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
 You got a pen for directions?
 
 310
 00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,752
 Look, pencil's fine, retard.
 
 311
 00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,315
 Just something to write with.
 It doesn't matter.
 
 312
 00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,794
 All right, so you ready?
 
 313
 00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,913
 All right, so you're gonna head west
 on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?
 
 314
 00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,557
 And you're gonna go past the casino
 with the big arrows in the parking lot.
 
 315
 00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,512
 All rightâ€”No, big arrows, giant arrows.
 
 316
 00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,836
 They light up and blink.
 You can't miss them.
 
 317
 00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,157
 Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
 because there's this dirt road.
 
 318
 00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,113
 It's right before the white sign
 with a 3 on it, okay?
 
 319
 00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,959
 Now you're gonna be way, way out
 in the boonies, okay?
 
 320
 00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,233
 Like crazy far, so just keep heading
 down that dirt road for like what?
 
 321
 00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,158
 About another 15 miles.
 
 322
 00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,999
 -Really? That far?
 -Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.
 
 323
 00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,158
 All right, just go down that road
 for like 15 more miles, all right?
 
 324
 00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,909
 I mean, we're way the hell out here.
 All right?
 
 325
 00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,476
 Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
 Bring water.
 
 326
 00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,238
 Leave now.
 
 327
 00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,199
 Here.
 
 328
 00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,958
 He's coming.
 
 329
 00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,435
 There was this guy
 on the Discovery Channel...
 
 330
 00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,949
 ...who broke his leg
 mountain biking...
 
 331
 00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,720
 ...and he had to drink urine for....
 
 332
 00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,673
 You know,
 just until the forest ranger found him.
 
 333
 00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,750
 He said it tasted like really hot,
 really old soda.
 
 334
 00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,432
 Look, we should just call, you know?
 
 335
 00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,269
 I'll be quick, just be like,
 "Yo, where are you?"
 
 336
 00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,959
 All right.
 
 337
 00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,598
 Come on.
 
 338
 00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,595
 Yo. Yo, where are you?
 
 339
 00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,993
 Oh, so you saw the white sign?
 
 340
 00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,634
 Yes, he's almost here.
 
 341
 00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,469
 Oh, man.
 We're getting really freaked out.
 
 342
 00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,035
 All right, so you're on the dirt road?
 
 343
 00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,151
 He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.
 
 344
 00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,318
 You just crossed the river?
 Yeah. Have you seen anything?
 
 345
 00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,511
 Wait, wait. What river?
 
 346
 00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,993
 Yeah, hey, yo, what river?
 
 347
 00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,634
 What the hell river you talking about?
 There's no river.
 
 348
 00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,956
 Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?
 
 349
 00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,713
 Phone's dead.
 
 350
 00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,992
 Now what?
 
 351
 00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,792
 Mr. White, what now?
 
 352
 00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,431
 Oh, come on. Seriously?
 
 353
 00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,272
 What's this?
 
 354
 00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,391
 I'm trying to...
 
 355
 00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,229
 ...trickle-charge the battery.
 
 356
 00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,917
 Seriously?
 
 357
 00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,276
 Just by turning that thing?
 
 358
 00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,198
 The commutator.
 
 359
 00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,235
 It's the part
 which generates the electricity.
 
 360
 00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,189
 Usually this little piston engine
 turns it...
 
 361
 00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,312
 ...but considering that it's lying here
 completely totalled....
 
 362
 00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,392
 Anyway.
 
 363
 00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,230
 Apply a little elbow grease.
 
 364
 00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,639
 It'll take longer, a lot longer...
 
 365
 00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,594
 ...but theoretically...
 
 366
 00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,591
 ...it should work.
 
 367
 00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,951
 Theoretically.
 
 368
 00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,398
 It has to work.
 
 369
 00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,992
 You understand?
 
 370
 00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,918
 Can I try?
 
 371
 00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,919
 Yeah.
 
 372
 00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,352
 How much longer?
 
 373
 00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,032
 I don't know.
 
 374
 00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,432
 Now?
 
 375
 00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,198
 Hey.
 
 376
 00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,718
 Mr. White.
 
 377
 00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,839
 Hey.
 
 378
 00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,599
 Yeah?
 
 379
 00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,990
 Yo, man, you hanging in?
 
 380
 00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,597
 Yeah, I'm good.
 
 381
 00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,230
 It's gotta be ready by now, right?
 
 382
 00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,548
 No, give it a little longer...
 
 383
 00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,751
 ...just to make sure we'reâ€”384
 00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
 Methylamine doesn't spoil...
 
 385
 00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,799
 ...does it?
 
 386
 00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,309
 No. That's not why we're here.
 
 387
 00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,319
 Yo.
 
 388
 00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,279
 Lie much?
 
 389
 00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,593
 Here, push.
 
 390
 00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,398
 Okay, okay, okay.
 
 391
 00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,153
 Now.
 
 392
 00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,153
 Go on.
 
 393
 00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,393
 Please, please, please.
 
 394
 00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,469
 Yes. Yes.
 
 395
 00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,996
 Come on. Damn. No, please, God.
 
 396
 00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,589
 No. God.
 
 397
 00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,512
 Please. Please.
 
 398
 00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,031
 Why couldn't I have just gone
 to Santa Fe?
 
 399
 00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,073
 Why? Why?
 
 400
 00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,471
 Mr. White.
 
 401
 00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,238
 Mr. White!
 
 402
 00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,072
 What are you doing?
 
 403
 00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,278
 Mr. White?
 
 404
 00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,351
 Oh, God.
 
 405
 00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,156
 I have this coming.
 
 406
 00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,039
 What?
 
 407
 00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,636
 I have it coming.
 
 408
 00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,591
 I deserve this.
 
 409
 00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,917
 Hey, snap out of it.
 
 410
 00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,908
 All right, first off, everything you did,
 you did for your family.
 
 411
 00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,553
 Right?
 
 412
 00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,199
 All I ever managed to do...
 
 413
 00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,597
 ...was worry and disappoint them...
 
 414
 00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,032
 ...and lie.
 
 415
 00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,709
 Oh, God.
 
 416
 00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,716
 All the lies.
 
 417
 00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,278
 I can't even....
 
 418
 00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,358
 I can't even keep them straight
 in my head anymore.
 
 419
 00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,080
 You know what? Screw this.
 
 420
 00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,716
 I'm walking. You can come or not.
 
 421
 00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,034
 Where's my other shoe?
 
 422
 00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,318
 Jesse. Jesse.
 
 423
 00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,151
 Your body...
 
 424
 00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,035
 ...is running dangerously low
 on electrolytes.
 
 425
 00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,110
 Sodium, potassium, calcium.
 
 426
 00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,675
 And when they're gone...
 
 427
 00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,510
 ...your brain ceases to communicate
 with your muscles.
 
 428
 00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,558
 Your lungs stop breathing,
 your heart stops pumping.
 
 429
 00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,594
 You go marching out there...
 
 430
 00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,509
 ...and within an hour,
 you will be dead.
 
 431
 00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,633
 Okay, you need to cut out
 all your loser crybaby crap right now...
 
 432
 00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,671
 ...and think of something scientific.
 
 433
 00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,997
 Somethingâ€”Something scientific, right.
 
 434
 00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,033
 What? Come on, man.
 You're smart, all right?
 
 435
 00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,800
 You made poison out of beans, yo.
 
 436
 00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,109
 All right, look. We gotâ€”437
 00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,235
 We got an entire lab right here,
 all right?
 
 438
 00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,396
 How about you take
 some of these chemicals...
 
 439
 00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,068
 ...and mix up some rocket fuel?
 
 440
 00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,078
 And we can just send up
 a signal flare.
 
 441
 00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,431
 Or you make some kind of robot
 to get us help...
 
 442
 00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,234
 ...or a homing device...
 
 443
 00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,192
 ...or build a new battery or....
 
 444
 00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,152
 Or wait, no.
 
 445
 00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,510
 What if we just take some stuff
 off of the RV...
 
 446
 00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,030
 ...and build it into something
 completely different?
 
 447
 00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,993
 You know, like a....
 Like a dune buggy.
 
 448
 00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,510
 And that way,
 we can just dune-buggy or....
 
 449
 00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,478
 What? Hey. What is it?
 
 450
 00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,913
 What?
 
 451
 00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,553
 Do you have any money?
 
 452
 00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,829
 Change, I mean. Coins.
 
 453
 00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,713
 -Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
 -Okay.
 
 454
 00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,672
 -Yes.
 -Gather them.
 
 455
 00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,589
 And washers and nuts and bolts
 and screws...
 
 456
 00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,031
 ...and whatever little pieces of metal
 we can think of that is galvanized.
 
 457
 00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,676
 It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.
 
 458
 00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,996
 -Solid zinc, okay.
 -Andâ€”And bring meâ€”459
 00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,475
 Bring me brake pads.
 
 460
 00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,116
 The front wheels should have discs.
 Take them off and bring them to me.
 
 461
 00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,959
 -Okay. Brake pads, okay.
 -Brake pads.
 
 462
 00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,315
 What are we building?
 
 463
 00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,913
 -You said it yourself.
 -A robot?
 
 464
 00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,159
 -A battery.
 -Yes.
 
 465
 00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,157
 Move!
 
 466
 00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,959
 This doesn't look like any battery
 I ever saw.
 
 467
 00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,230
 Well, trust me, it is a battery.
 
 468
 00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,032
 Or rather, one cell of a battery.
 
 469
 00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,994
 Here. Cut up the last two sponges.
 
 470
 00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,792
 Remember the electrolytes?
 
 471
 00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,235
 Well, think about it.
 
 472
 00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,951
 A battery is a galvanic cell.
 
 473
 00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,799
 It's no more than an anode
 and a cathode...
 
 474
 00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,036
 ...separated by an electrolyte, right?
 
 475
 00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,717
 -Right.
 -Yeah, well, anyway.
 
 476
 00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,390
 Here. On one side,
 you have mercuric oxide...
 
 477
 00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,716
 ...and graphite
 from your brake pads.
 
 478
 00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,913
 This is the cathode.
 This is the positive terminal.
 
 479
 00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,193
 This is where the supply of current
 flows out from, you see?
 
 480
 00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,916
 Then.... Here, I'll show you.
 
 481
 00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,554
 On the opposite side is our anode.
 
 482
 00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,513
 This.
 
 483
 00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,359
 It's zinc.
 
 484
 00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,429
 It's what we find in our coins
 and anything galvanized.
 
 485
 00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,916
 -So the sponge is the electrolyte?
 -Yeah.
 
 486
 00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,829
 Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
 is the electrolyte.
 
 487
 00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,953
 But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
 the sponges in.
 
 488
 00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,319
 Good.
 
 489
 00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,870
 Good. And now, what shall we use...
 
 490
 00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,640
 ...to conduct
 this beautiful current with?
 
 491
 00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,955
 What one particular element
 comes to mind?
 
 492
 00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,317
 Wire.
 
 493
 00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,833
 Copper.
 
 494
 00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,996
 -Oh, I mean--
 -Copper.
 
 495
 00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,553
 Right.
 
 496
 00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,432
 The only question now is
 will this supply enough current?
 
 497
 00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,438
 And how many cells will we need?
 
 498
 00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,393
 We've only got material enough
 for six.
 
 499
 00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,192
 Okay.
 
 500
 00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,992
 Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.
 
 501
 00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,599
 All right.
 
 502
 00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,398
 Cathode.
 
 503
 00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,833
 Anode.
 
 504
 00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,918
 Damn. That is good.
 
 505
 00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,271
 That is very good.
 Okay. Here we go.
 
 506
 00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,395
 Come on.
 
 507
 00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,152
 ''Attention, passengers.:''
 ''Please maintain visual contact...''
 
 508
 00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,555
 ''...with your personal belongings''
 ''at all times.''
 
 509
 00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,149
 ''Any bags left unattended''
 ''will be confiscated by....''
 
 510
 00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,032
 How's the...?
 
 511
 00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,633
 It's fine.
 
 512
 00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,352
 I know I can trust you to....
 
 513
 00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,558
 Yeah.
 
 514
 00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,993
 Hey, whatever happens...
 
 515
 00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,749
 ...your family will get your share.
 
 516
 00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,993
 Thank you.
 
 517
 00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,158
 So...
 
 518
 00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,876
 ...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?
 
 519
 00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,993
 Yeah.
 
 520
 00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,837
 ''How's everyone doing?''
 
 521
 00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,519
 Is that baby ever gonna come out,
 you think?
 
 522
 00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,554
 -I know. I know, enough already. It's--
 -I'm teasing.
 
 523
 00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,637
 Everything in its time.
 
 524
 00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,914
 Walt, I have your scan results.
 
 525
 00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,630
 -Yeah.
 -You're showing signs of remission.
 
 526
 00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,588
 -Oh, my God.
 -I wanna clarify.
 
 527
 00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,394
 There are misconceptions
 about what remission signifies.
 
 528
 00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,875
 It does not mean
 that the patient is cured.
 
 529
 00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,038
 To classify someone
 as in remission...
 
 530
 00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,834
 ...we only need to determine
 that the tumour hasn't grown.
 
 531
 00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,315
 That it hasn't grown? Jesus.
 
 532
 00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,989
 Technically speaking...
 
 533
 00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,112
 ...a tumour can remain
 the exact same size it was before...
 
 534
 00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,675
 ...and the patient
 could still be in remission.
 
 535
 00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,270
 Now, in Walt's case,
 with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...
 
 536
 00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,391
 ...I'd like to see, I hope to see...
 
 537
 00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,070
 ...at least a 25- to 35-percent
 reduction in tumour mass...
 
 538
 00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,559
 ...something to tell me that the cancer
 has responded to the therapy.
 
 539
 00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,478
 Everybody still with me?
 
 540
 00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,430
 And how has my cancer responded?
 
 541
 00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,871
 Walt, your tumour has shrunk
 by 80 percent.
 
 542
 00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,312
 -Oh, my God.
 -Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
 
 543
 00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,670
 Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.
 
 544
 00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,189
 Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?
 
 545
 00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,233
 -Mom, yeah.
 -Yes, 80 percent is a lot.
 
 546
 00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,435
 -Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
 -Sweetheart, you were right.
 
 547
 00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,279
 -It's very good news.
 -It's very good news.
 
 548
 00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,392
 -Oh, my God.
 -My God, are you kidding me?
 
 549
 00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,639
 Just when I try to get out,
 they pull me back in.
 
 550
 00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,632
 That's great.
 
 551
 00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,312
 Now, that cough is the other thing
 we need to discuss.
 
 552
 00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,229
 According to your scan, Walt,
 you have radiation pneumonitis.
 
 553
 00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,432
 It's okay. This is fairly common.
 
 554
 00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,918
 See that scary-looking thing there?
 
 555
 00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,797
 That's tissue inflammation.
 It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.
 
 556
 00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,113
 It's usually not serious,
 but it can produce a cough like that.
 
 557
 00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,311
 I'll prescribe some prednisone.
 
 558
 00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,318
 Tissue inflammation? I....
 
 559
 00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,397
 Are you sure about that? I mean, I--
 
 560
 00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,152
 Because the other day,
 I was coughing up some blood.
 
 561
 00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,238
 -What?
 -You probably have a tear...
 
 562
 00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,953
 ...in your oesophagus
 from coughing.
 
 563
 00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,833
 That can be serious.
 You could rupture and bleed to death.
 
 564
 00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,272
 This is something we're gonna have to
 deal with before you leave today.
 
 565
 00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,233
 Wait a minute. When did this happen?
 Why didn't you tell me?
 
 566
 00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,874
 -I'm sorry, I just--
 -No more secrets, Walt.
 
 567
 00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,629
 With something like this,
 you have to call me immediately.
 
 568
 00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,839
 Now, with these results,
 we're not completely out of the woods.
 
 569
 00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,871
 But now at least
 we have some options...
 
 570
 00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,833
 ...the most important of which
 is time.
 
 571
 00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,190
 We'll have more to discuss
 in the next few weeks.
 
 572
 00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,029
 But for now, I'd say that you folks
 have earned some celebrating.
 
 573
 00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,157
 -Yes.
 -Yeah.
 
 574
 00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,475
 Oh, my God.
