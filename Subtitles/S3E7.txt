 â€‹1
 00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,749
 Why?
 
 2
 00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,036
 Why is this still under discussion?
 
 3
 00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,028
 I don't like him.
 
 4
 00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,589
 I don't care who he knows.
 
 5
 00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,154
 We're supposed to trust
 him with our products.
 
 6
 00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,955
 Big man.
 
 7
 00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,713
 Big Generalissimo!
 
 8
 00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,713
 Big fry cook is more like it.
 
 9
 00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,310
 The "Chicken Man."
 
 10
 00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,473
 You will do what you want.
 
 11
 00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,712
 But you have my vote.
 
 12
 00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,439
 Never trust a South American.
 
 13
 00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,992
 Dirty, dirty people.
 
 14
 00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,877
 He broke my toy! He broke my toy!
 
 15
 00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,032
 He was just having fun.
 
 16
 00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,075
 You'll get over it.
 
 17
 00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,073
 No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!
 
 18
 00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,237
 Marco.
 
 19
 00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,789
 Grab your old uncle a beer,
 would you?
 
 20
 00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,515
 No, no. A cold one.
 
 21
 00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,753
 This is what you wanted.
 
 22
 00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,510
 Your brother dead. Right?
 
 23
 00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,559
 You're going to have to
 try harder than that...
 
 24
 00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,197
 ...if you want to save him.
 
 25
 00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,275
 How much longer do you think
 he has down there?
 
 26
 00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,475
 One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?
 
 27
 00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,718
 Family is all.
 
 28
 00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,111
 Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.
 
 29
 00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,317
 All right, you can call my lawyer,
 Saul Goodman.
 
 30
 00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,152
 Talk to my lawyer, all right?
 
 31
 00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,597
 You hear me? I got nothing to say.
 I told you, you can call my...
 
 32
 00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,789
 Christ!
 
 33
 00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,349
 You got my cell phone number,
 my wife's name! How did you do it?
 
 34
 00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,074
 Talk! Who you working with?!
 
 35
 00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,113
 Yes, sir.
 
 36
 00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,072
 If you're ready to talk...
 
 37
 00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,037
 ...they wanna get a statement.
 
 38
 00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,160
 Your side of what happened here.
 
 39
 00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,357
 Or we can hold them off
 till another time.
 
 40
 00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,998
 Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.
 
 41
 00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,237
 There it is.
 
 42
 00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,793
 Yo, Adrian.
 
 43
 00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,155
 Rocky called,
 he wants his face back.
 
 44
 00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,472
 Come on, I gotta cheer you up.
 
 45
 00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,473
 You see that?
 That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.
 
 46
 00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,517
 You understand
 get-out-of-jail-free card?
 
 47
 00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,638
 I mean, just blink once
 if you're following.
 
 48
 00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,475
 The DEA's worst nightmare
 is that face out in public.
 
 49
 00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,518
 They'll have to steer a wide berth
 of young Master Pinkman...
 
 50
 00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,036
 ...for fear of the PR poop storm
 that will rain down on them...
 
 51
 00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,875
 ...if this story ever gets out.
 I mean, this beating?
 
 52
 00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,071
 Best thing for you.
 
 53
 00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,549
 You're home free.
 
 54
 00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,352
 Good, right?
 
 55
 00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,359
 Right.
 
 56
 00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,311
 Oh, my God.
 
 57
 00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
 You're now the cute one of the group.
 Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.
 
 58
 00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,916
 This is... I...
 
 59
 00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,113
 Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
 This should not have happened.
 
 60
 00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,711
 But it did.
 
 61
 00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,310
 No thanks to you.
 
 62
 00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,115
 But the plan did work.
 
 63
 00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,432
 We would've been locked up right now
 if we didn't lure him away. But this...
 
 64
 00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,110
 This... I just...
 
 65
 00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,839
 I never saw this coming.
 
 66
 00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,391
 So...
 
 67
 00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,959
 What...?
 
 68
 00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,108
 What happens now?
 
 69
 00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,191
 What happens now?
 
 70
 00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,273
 I'll tell you what happens now.
 
 71
 00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,672
 Your scumbag brother-in-law
 is finished.
 
 72
 00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,593
 Done.
 
 73
 00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,189
 You understand?
 
 74
 00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,395
 I will own him when this is over.
 
 75
 00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,520
 Every cent he... earns...
 
 76
 00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,036
 ...every cent his wife... earns...
 
 77
 00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,475
 ...is mine.
 
 78
 00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,797
 Anyplace he goes...
 
 79
 00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,916
 ...anywhere he turns...
 
 80
 00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,036
 ...I'm gonna be there...
 
 81
 00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,714
 ...grabbing my share.
 
 82
 00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,637
 He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
 for pennies...
 
 83
 00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,995
 ...and I'll be standing over him...
 
 84
 00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,310
 ...to get my cut.
 
 85
 00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,751
 He'll see me when he wakes up...
 
 86
 00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,630
 ...and when he crawls to sleep
 in whatever rat hole is left for him...
 
 87
 00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,190
 ...after I shred his house down.
 
 88
 00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,908
 I will haunt his crusty ass...
 
 89
 00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,752
 ...forever...
 
 90
 00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,991
 ...until the day...
 
 91
 00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,351
 ...he sticks a gun up his mouth...
 
 92
 00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,556
 ...and pulls the trigger...
 
 93
 00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,757
 ...just to get me out of his head.
 
 94
 00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,398
 That's what happens next.
 
 95
 00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,790
 My advice:
 
 96
 00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,113
 That's probably
 not a good strategy.
 
 97
 00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,068
 They're scared of you right now.
 They want nothing to do with you.
 
 98
 00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,992
 But if you hit them...
 
 99
 00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,799
 ...they're forced to hit back hard.
 
 100
 00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,714
 I mean, they will turn over every rock
 hither, thither and yon...
 
 101
 00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,475
 ...until someone spills the beans on you
 and anyone associated with you...
 
 102
 00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,153
 ...present company included.
 
 103
 00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,232
 Yes, I think what Saul is saying
 makes a lot of sense.
 
 104
 00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,713
 Jesse, move on with your life.
 
 105
 00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,313
 Leave it behind, all of it.
 
 106
 00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,630
 Nothing changes...
 
 107
 00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,155
 ...once I walk out of here.
 
 108
 00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,037
 I get myself a new RV
 and go start cooking again.
 
 109
 00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,437
 How exactly do you think...
 
 110
 00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,876
 ...you're going to get away with that?
 They will catch you.
 
 111
 00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,837
 - So what?
 - What?
 
 112
 00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,911
 I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.
 
 113
 00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,790
 Hey, I may have overstated
 the power of your face.
 
 114
 00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,349
 Not this.
 
 115
 00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,637
 If the cops catch me...
 
 116
 00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,718
 ...I give them
 what they want the most.
 
 117
 00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,473
 You.
 
 118
 00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,236
 They nab me...
 
 119
 00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,556
 ...I make a deal...
 
 120
 00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,191
 ...to give up the great Heisenberg...
 
 121
 00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,433
 ...and his million-dollar drug ring.
 
 122
 00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,640
 You're my free pass...
 
 123
 00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,431
 ...bitch.
 
 124
 00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,309
 ''You're so sure.''
 
 125
 00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,075
 Look, if he didn't give up my name
 while Hank was beating him...
 
 126
 00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,753
 ...he's never going to talk.
 
 127
 00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,156
 What do you think that was, a bluff?
 
 128
 00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,676
 He wants your brother-in-law.
 And there's gonna be lawyers...
 
 129
 00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,035
 ...creaming their Underoos
 for a case like that.
 
 130
 00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,590
 I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
 cause so much collateral damage.
 
 131
 00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,239
 And him cooking again?
 
 132
 00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,393
 Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
 and he's facing 20 years...
 
 133
 00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,838
 ...what'll he do then? Believe me,
 there's no honour among thieves.
 
 134
 00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,958
 Except for us, of course.
 
 135
 00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,353
 No, he'll...
 
 136
 00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,476
 He'll come around.
 
 137
 00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,989
 And if he doesn't...
 
 138
 00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,549
 ...there may come a time
 to talk options.
 
 139
 00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,234
 Options?
 
 140
 00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,957
 I'm convinced
 Mr. Pinkman was involved...
 
 141
 00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,317
 ...in the manufacture and distribution
 of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...
 
 142
 00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,550
 ...specifically what we call
 the blue meth.
 
 143
 00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,551
 I tracked him to a scrap yard...
 
 144
 00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,109
 ...where he stored
 an early-'80s camper...
 
 145
 00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,918
 ...an RV.
 
 146
 00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,749
 While waiting for a warrant
 to search this vehicle...
 
 147
 00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,673
 ...which I believe to be
 a rolling meth lab...
 
 148
 00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,195
 ...I received a telephone call...
 
 149
 00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,270
 ...telling me my wife Marie
 had been injured in an accident.
 
 150
 00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,674
 Upon hearing the news...
 
 151
 00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,913
 ...I left Mr. Pinkman
 and his vehicle to tend to my wife.
 
 152
 00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,076
 Arriving at the hospital, I learned
 the... emergency call was a hoax.
 
 153
 00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,516
 My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.
 
 154
 00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,233
 So I immediately went back to
 the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
 
 155
 00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,595
 Most likely destroyed on site.
 
 156
 00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,877
 And it was at this point you drove
 to the home of Jesse Pinkman?
 
 157
 00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,039
 I think we're done here.
 
 158
 00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,668
 Agent Schrader needs to get home...
 
 159
 00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,829
 ...get some rest.
 
 160
 00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,630
 That's fine. But just to confirm,
 you're taking the Fifth here?
 
 161
 00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,233
 Yeah, that's correct.
 
 162
 00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,152
 Okay. Well...
 
 163
 00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,709
 ...we just wanna give you all
 a heads up.
 
 164
 00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,436
 Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
 in this matter.
 
 165
 00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,639
 He's given a detailed version
 of events as he sees them.
 
 166
 00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,074
 The word of a meth head.
 
 167
 00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,832
 We know all about his history.
 
 168
 00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,356
 We're well aware,
 but toxicology on Pinkman...
 
 169
 00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,755
 His blood is clean, he's not using.
 
 170
 00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,912
 The kid is even refusing his
 doctor-ordered pain meds...
 
 171
 00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,752
 ...far as we can tell.
 
 172
 00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,958
 So...
 
 173
 00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,432
 ...where do we go from here?
 
 174
 00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,114
 A couple of gentlemen
 from OPR will come down...
 
 175
 00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,077
 ...probably tomorrow morning.
 
 176
 00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,310
 Janice will give us an exact time.
 
 177
 00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,270
 And you men will be continuing
 your investigation, so...
 
 178
 00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,271
 - Thanks for your time.
 - Right. We just...
 
 179
 00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,634
 We need one more thing.
 
 180
 00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,678
 A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
 For the record.
 
 181
 00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,312
 Yes, of course.
 
 182
 00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,676
 Bandage off, if you would.
 
 183
 00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,110
 On the table is fine.
 
 184
 00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,229
 Flat on the table. That's fine.
 
 185
 00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,279
 It's all gonna work out.
 
 186
 00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,989
 You've been too good to them
 for too many years.
 
 187
 00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,314
 I hope it goes without saying we're not
 talking to anybody about this, okay?
 
 188
 00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,033
 Okay.
 
 189
 00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,552
 Marie...
 
 190
 00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,392
 ...who?
 
 191
 00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,509
 Hi.
 
 192
 00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,877
 Do you have a minute?
 
 193
 00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,999
 Sure.
 
 194
 00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,155
 I guess crime does pay.
 
 195
 00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,510
 I don't suppose you just came by
 to insult me.
 
 196
 00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,193
 No. We need to talk.
 
 197
 00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,751
 You heard about Hank?
 
 198
 00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,915
 About what happened
 with this Jesse Pinkman?
 
 199
 00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,158
 Yes, I know.
 
 200
 00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,550
 Whatever Hank was investigating...
 
 201
 00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,429
 ...him trying to find an RV...
 
 202
 00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,318
 ...is there any danger...
 
 203
 00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,755
 ...that could lead back to you?
 
 204
 00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,033
 No.
 
 205
 00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,833
 Why would it?
 
 206
 00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,277
 Is this why you're here?
 
 207
 00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,638
 I'm here to talk about Hank.
 
 208
 00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,512
 You know what's gonna happen to him
 if this Pinkman presses charges?
 
 209
 00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,149
 Hank could lose... everything.
 
 210
 00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,991
 I thought maybe...
 
 211
 00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,155
 ...there's a way you could help him.
 
 212
 00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,158
 How?
 
 213
 00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,119
 Contact Pinkman.
 
 214
 00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,236
 Get him to drop the charges.
 
 215
 00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,473
 I don't know what kind of relationship
 you picture me having with this person.
 
 216
 00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,952
 - I'm not asking.
 - He was... He's... He's not my friend.
 
 217
 00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,475
 - It's not as if we were... even close.
 - I'm...
 
 218
 00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,631
 I'm not asking.
 
 219
 00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,268
 But there must be something
 you could say.
 
 220
 00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,355
 Isn't it even worth a try?
 
 221
 00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,430
 Hank is your family.
 
 222
 00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,033
 Not currently.
 
 223
 00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,235
 What?
 
 224
 00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,114
 I said, not currently.
 
 225
 00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,472
 I'm late. I have to go.
 
 226
 00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,669
 Hello.
 
 227
 00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,634
 I was starting to get worried.
 
 228
 00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,912
 Car trouble.
 
 229
 00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,717
 Oh, that's a bummer.
 
 230
 00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,388
 You should call me next time.
 I'll pick you up.
 
 231
 00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,991
 No sandals today?
 
 232
 00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,319
 I just thought...
 
 233
 00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,788
 A bit more professional.
 
 234
 00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,278
 Well, everything is on track.
 
 235
 00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,755
 We got our distillate.
 Just waiting to...
 
 236
 00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,797
 Let's get our trays ready.
 
 237
 00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,269
 - Clean, no moisture.
 - Done.
 
 238
 00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,432
 Is our...?
 
 239
 00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,719
 Our solvent filtered?
 
 240
 00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,872
 I thought you might ask that.
 
 241
 00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,029
 Done.
 
 242
 00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,038
 That's good.
 
 243
 00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,429
 That's good.
 
 244
 00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,717
 Hand in glove,
 that's what we strive for.
 
 245
 00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,751
 You know, this might be the beginning
 of a beautiful friendship.
 
 246
 00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,357
 So you the gentlemen?
 
 247
 00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,395
 Lucky you boys caught me,
 I got a load to pick up in Memphis.
 
 248
 00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,712
 I can hammer it out in about 15,
 but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.
 
 249
 00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,110
 She's got this fetish,
 she likes to get peed on.
 
 250
 00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,477
 I was hoping to see her tonight
 but she wants to sleep before 10...
 
 251
 00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,952
 ...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
 because traffic can be a wild card.
 
 252
 00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,918
 Thing is, women who like to get peed on
 tend to be from the warmer climates.
 
 253
 00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,958
 You'd think the ones in colder zones
 would be more inclined.
 
 254
 00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,429
 Maybe it's a shock
 if the body's not acclimated...
 
 255
 00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,797
 ...but, you know, I leave that
 for smarter minds than me.
 
 256
 00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,032
 Science is a mystery.
 
 257
 00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,040
 Well, take a gander.
 Prices are negotiable.
 
 258
 00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,113
 Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
 I'm running a special on these honeys.
 
 259
 00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,432
 JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
 known as Black Death. Check it out.
 
 260
 00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,352
 Like that?
 So sweet, you wanna lick it.
 
 261
 00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,750
 Nickel-plated brass casing,
 Lubalox coat.
 
 262
 00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,071
 Sucker has six razor claws
 that expand upon impact:
 
 263
 00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,629
 Shred your mama's head
 like a cabbage.
 
 264
 00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,194
 Keep it. On the house.
 But I been windjamming enough.
 
 265
 00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,432
 Tell me what you're looking for,
 what it is you need.
 
 266
 00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,835
 Vests.
 
 267
 00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,798
 Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.
 
 268
 00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,598
 Right here.
 
 269
 00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,636
 Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
 non-interwoven Kevlar fibre.
 
 270
 00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,475
 Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
 a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.
 
 271
 00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,189
 And lightweight? So lightweight,
 you'll forget you're wearing it.
 
 272
 00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,079
 They work?
 
 273
 00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,790
 Sure as shit, they do.
 
 274
 00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,951
 I don't leave home without it.
 
 275
 00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,318
 What the hell?
 
 276
 00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,788
 You broke my freaking rib,
 you maniac son of a bitch.
 
 277
 00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,478
 You're welcome!
 
 278
 00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,949
 Gale.
 
 279
 00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,790
 What temperature did you set here?
 
 280
 00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,439
 Here?
 
 281
 00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,228
 Station five, 75 C.
 
 282
 00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,990
 I said 85.
 
 283
 00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,275
 Eight-five.
 
 284
 00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,719
 I wrote it down. You said 75.
 
 285
 00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,950
 - I wrote it.
 - Well, you wrote it wrong.
 
 286
 00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,678
 That's not what I said.
 
 287
 00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,068
 I said 85.
 
 288
 00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,358
 It's always been 85.
 
 289
 00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,757
 Not 75. Not 95.
 
 290
 00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,069
 Eighty-five.
 
 291
 00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,750
 This is chemistry. Degrees matter.
 
 292
 00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,468
 I'm sorry.
 
 293
 00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,519
 I'm very sorry.
 
 294
 00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,749
 Great.
 
 295
 00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,399
 You're sorry, meanwhile...
 
 296
 00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,348
 ...you've just brewed 50 gallons
 of useless sludge. Congratulations.
 
 297
 00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,796
 Just dump it. Dump it all.
 
 298
 00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,837
 This batch is ruined.
 
 299
 00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,431
 You look nice.
 
 300
 00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,355
 I look like a TV weatherman.
 
 301
 00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,037
 You want a coffee?
 
 302
 00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,233
 No.
 
 303
 00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,676
 I squeezed some orange juice.
 You want a glass of orange juice?
 
 304
 00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,073
 I'm all right.
 
 305
 00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,109
 What are you gonna tell them?
 
 306
 00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,432
 Here's what you'll tell them.
 
 307
 00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,353
 He attacked you.
 
 308
 00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,918
 - He attacked me?
 - He swung at you with something.
 
 309
 00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,958
 - Swung at me?
 - He attacked you with a pipe.
 
 310
 00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,678
 A pipe.
 
 311
 00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,397
 It happened fast. He resisted arrest
 and muscle memory kicked in...
 
 312
 00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,755
 ...and you had to disarm him.
 
 313
 00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,592
 Muscle memory.
 
 314
 00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,675
 Happens all the time. Years of training,
 your body acted faster than your brain.
 
 315
 00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,512
 You had no choice but to hit him.
 
 316
 00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,672
 - You had to fight back.
 - Marie, Marie, Marie.
 
 317
 00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,193
 No.
 
 318
 00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,192
 I'm not gonna go in there and lie.
 
 319
 00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,638
 It's some lowlife degenerate
 versus you...
 
 320
 00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,074
 ...doing the job you're supposed to.
 
 321
 00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,790
 Why should you be the one
 who pays...
 
 322
 00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,712
 ...for doing the right thing?
 
 323
 00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,474
 Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.
 
 324
 00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,675
 It's not what the job is.
 
 325
 00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,914
 I'm supposed to be better than that.
 
 326
 00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,997
 And you made one mistake.
 
 327
 00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,193
 No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...
 
 328
 00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,397
 I've been...
 
 329
 00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,915
 ...unravelling, you know?
 
 330
 00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,954
 I don't sleep at night anymore.
 
 331
 00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,197
 I freeze.
 
 332
 00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,237
 I freeze up.
 
 333
 00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,270
 My chest gets all tight.
 I can't breathe.
 
 334
 00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,915
 Just...
 
 335
 00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,592
 I panic.
 
 336
 00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,193
 Ever since that Salamanca thing.
 
 337
 00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,312
 I mean, Tuco Salamanca.
 
 338
 00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,268
 If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
 between the... eyes...
 
 339
 00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,956
 It changed me.
 
 340
 00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,840
 And I can't seem to control it.
 
 341
 00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,311
 I tried to fight it.
 
 342
 00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,352
 But then...
 
 343
 00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,232
 ...El Paso.
 
 344
 00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,869
 And it's just gotten worse.
 
 345
 00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,316
 What I did to Pinkman...
 
 346
 00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,230
 ...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
 That's not me.
 
 347
 00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,037
 All this...
 
 348
 00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,709
 ...everything that's happened, I...
 
 349
 00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,276
 I swear to God, Marie,
 I think the universe...
 
 350
 00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,070
 ...is trying to tell me something...
 
 351
 00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,276
 ...and I'm finally...
 
 352
 00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,316
 ...ready to listen.
 
 353
 00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,917
 I'm just not the man I thought I was.
 
 354
 00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,509
 I think I'm done as a cop.
 
 355
 00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,079
 Now, this is not an easy decision,
 but it is one that I have to make.
 
 356
 00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,878
 I'm sorry.
 
 357
 00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,750
 This whole Gale situation, he's...
 
 358
 00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,275
 He's just not working out.
 
 359
 00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,036
 Yes, now.
 
 360
 00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,119
 It may sound unorthodox...
 
 361
 00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,877
 ...but I think our first best option...
 
 362
 00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,955
 ...is Jesse Pinkman.
 
 363
 00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,999
 Hello?
 
 364
 00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,394
 No, look. There's a shorthand
 that exists between us...
 
 365
 00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,232
 ...experience together...
 
 366
 00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,713
 ...at a level that, quite frankly,
 I'm just never going to reach with Gale.
 
 367
 00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,720
 Look, Mr. Fring...
 
 368
 00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,514
 ...when I accepted your offer,
 I was told the lab is mine.
 
 369
 00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,114
 And I know best how to run it.
 
 370
 00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,679
 Thank you.
 
 371
 00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,389
 Thank you.
 
 372
 00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,358
 Yes, I will. I will.
 
 373
 00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,875
 Okay. Goodbye.
 
 374
 00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,397
 ''Listen, something's come up.''
 
 375
 00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,595
 I think it's a good opportunity.
 
 376
 00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,912
 There's been a job opening.
 
 377
 00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,559
 I need a new lab assistant.
 
 378
 00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,837
 I already did my time.
 
 379
 00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,515
 Why don't you just go get yourself
 a monkey?
 
 380
 00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,478
 I don't want a monkey.
 
 381
 00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,631
 I want you.
 
 382
 00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,075
 Oh, gee, thanks.
 
 383
 00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,435
 Well, not interested.
 
 384
 00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,277
 I got my own thing going on.
 
 385
 00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,353
 And nice try, saving your asshead
 brother-in-law.
 
 386
 00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,948
 That's not why I'm here, Jesse.
 
 387
 00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,712
 There's more.
 
 388
 00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,798
 It's more than an assistant.
 
 389
 00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,839
 Partners.
 
 390
 00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,872
 We'll be partners again.
 
 391
 00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,430
 Split everything fifty-fifty,
 just like before.
 
 392
 00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,916
 One-point-five million dollars each.
 
 393
 00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,432
 No.
 
 394
 00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,954
 - I don't think you heard...
 - I heard you fine.
 
 395
 00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,111
 I said no.
 
 396
 00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,150
 Let me understand this.
 
 397
 00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,315
 You're turning down
 one and a half million dollars...
 
 398
 00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,950
 I am not turning down the money.
 
 399
 00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,351
 I am turning down you.
 
 400
 00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,351
 You get it?
 
 401
 00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,309
 I want nothing to do with you.
 
 402
 00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,068
 Ever since I met you...
 
 403
 00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,432
 ...everything I've... ever cared about...
 
 404
 00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,636
 ...is gone.
 
 405
 00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,197
 Ruined, turned to shit...
 
 406
 00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,559
 ...dead, ever since I hooked up
 with the great Heisenberg.
 
 407
 00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,797
 I have never been more alone.
 
 408
 00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,079
 I have nothing!
 
 409
 00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,196
 No one!
 
 410
 00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,075
 All right? It's all gone!
 
 411
 00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,958
 Get it?
 
 412
 00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,109
 No.
 
 413
 00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,794
 No, no. Why...?
 
 414
 00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,030
 Why would you get it?
 
 415
 00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,389
 What do you even care,
 as long as you get what you want?
 
 416
 00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,788
 Right?
 
 417
 00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,750
 You don't give a shit about me.
 
 418
 00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,074
 You said I was no good.
 
 419
 00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,756
 I'm nothing!
 
 420
 00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,232
 Why would you want me, huh?
 
 421
 00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,633
 You said my meth is inferior, right?
 
 422
 00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,188
 Right? Hey, you said my cook
 was garbage!
 
 423
 00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,590
 Hey, screw you, man!
 
 424
 00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,035
 Screw you.
 
 425
 00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,599
 Your meth is good, Jesse.
 
 426
 00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,076
 As good as mine.
 
 427
 00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,553
 Yeah.
 
 428
 00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,110
 ''Fifty-fifty.''
 
 429
 00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,998
 Yes, fifty-fifty.
 
 430
 00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,032
 Okay.
 
 431
 00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,597
 Partners.
 
 432
 00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,112
 Good.
 
 433
 00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,473
 And this is the statement
 you want to give?
 
 434
 00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,872
 Yes, sir.
 
 435
 00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,633
 - Hank, you don't have to do this.
 - No, I...
 
 436
 00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,273
 I do.
 
 437
 00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,953
 I'm good.
 
 438
 00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,716
 So we understand
 if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.
 
 439
 00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,517
 That's the way it happened.
 
 440
 00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,351
 I accept the consequences.
 
 441
 00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,960
 In the light of these facts...
 
 442
 00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,355
 ...as of this moment,
 you're suspended without pay.
 
 443
 00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,156
 I have to ask you to hand over
 your badge and your gun.
 
 444
 00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,113
 Yes, sir.
 
 445
 00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,598
 Schrader.
 
 446
 00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,354
 Hold up.
 
 447
 00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,999
 Yes, sir?
 
 448
 00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,511
 I just wanted to tell you something.
 
 449
 00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,116
 And you didn't hear it from me.
 Don't want you to get your hopes up...
 
 450
 00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,750
 ...but the word in the pipeline is
 Pinkman isn't pressing charges.
 
 451
 00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,512
 - Why not?
 - Who the hell knows?
 
 452
 00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,874
 Maybe you have a guardian angel.
 
 453
 00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,752
 It went fine.
 
 454
 00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,876
 Well, fine means what it means,
 yeah.
 
 455
 00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,999
 I'll...
 
 456
 00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,194
 I'll tell you all about it
 when I get home, okay?
 
 457
 00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,391
 Yeah. It's...
 
 458
 00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,472
 Yeah, it's just...
 
 459
 00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,477
 I don't know, baby, I just think...
 
 460
 00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,632
 I think we may be okay. Yeah.
 
 461
 00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,110
 Okay. I love you too.
 
 462
 00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,472
 - Schrader.
 - ''I need you to listen very carefully.''
 
 463
 00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,631
 ''Two men are coming to kill you.''
 
 464
 00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,149
 Come again?
 
 465
 00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,233
 ''They're approaching your car.''
 ''You have one minute.''
 
 466
 00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,749
 I don't get the gag, jagoff.
 Who is this?
 
 467
 00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,797
 ''They're coming.''
 
 468
 00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,759
 Hello?
 
 469
 00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,109
 Hey, li...
 
 470
 00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,910
 Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
 but it's dumb even by your standards...
 
 471
 00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,071
 ...so call me when you get this.
 
 472
 00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,794
 Finish him.
 
 473
 00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,508
 Jesus.
 
 474
 00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,678
 No.
 
 475
 00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,118
 Too easy.
