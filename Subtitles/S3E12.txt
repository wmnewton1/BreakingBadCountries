 1
 00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,798
 Hey, guys.
 
 2
 00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,194
 So if it's okay, I was thinking
 about using this one for the test.
 
 3
 00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,316
 Mom's brakes are very sticky...
 
 4
 00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,395
 ...and you barely press down on them
 and it's like a screech.
 
 5
 00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,637
 Sure.
 
 6
 00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,199
 But I'm good?
 
 7
 00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,512
 Yeah, you're great. Why?
 
 8
 00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,277
 Are my feet okay?
 
 9
 00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,239
 I looked it up. New Mexico says
 all I need is a note from a doctor.
 
 10
 00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,868
 I know it's not the right way and all...
 
 11
 00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,079
 ...but once I get my provisional,
 I can keep working at it.
 
 12
 00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,959
 Well, as long as it gets you safely
 from point A to point B...
 
 13
 00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
 ...then who am I to argue?
 
 14
 00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,713
 Hi.
 
 15
 00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,472
 You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
 Yes, you are.
 
 16
 00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,555
 I know.
 
 17
 00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,439
 - Here you go.
 - Here you go.
 
 18
 00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,160
 - All right.
 - Thank you.
 
 19
 00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,949
 - Got it?
 - Yeah.
 
 20
 00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,350
 Okay. All right.
 
 21
 00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,634
 - So 9 a.m. Saturday?
 - Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.
 
 22
 00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,916
 So which means
 pick me up about 8:30?
 
 23
 00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,640
 - I'll be here with bells on.
 - What?
 
 24
 00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,429
 It's just a saying.
 Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.
 
 25
 00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,469
 - Hey.
 - Hey, Mom.
 
 26
 00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,437
 - Hi. Do you have a minute?
 - Yeah.
 
 27
 00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,909
 - Could you keep an eye on your sister?
 - Sure.
 
 28
 00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,308
 - Thanks.
 - See you, Dad.
 
 29
 00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,040
 - Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
 - Thank you.
 
 30
 00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,591
 Have you thought anymore
 about what we discussed?
 
 31
 00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,990
 "Thought anymore"
 meaning reconsidered? No.
 
 32
 00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,469
 So show me the flaw in it.
 
 33
 00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,709
 Flaws, Skyler.
 Flaws. Plural, not singular.
 
 34
 00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,112
 Where do you want me to start?
 
 35
 00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,070
 Hey, I don't love this situation,
 all right, that you put me in.
 
 36
 00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,591
 However, let's just stick
 with what makes sense here.
 
 37
 00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,716
 You took the seed money
 you won gambling...
 
 38
 00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,269
 ...invested it in the car wash
 that you helped run for four years.
 
 39
 00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,672
 You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
 because guess what? She's actually a bookkeeper.
 
 40
 00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,877
 Now that is a story an auditor can believe.
 So what am I missing?
 
 41
 00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,759
 You're missing that you should just 
 take this money that I give you...
 
 42
 00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,956
 ...and not look too closely at it.
 
 43
 00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,398
 So, if God forbid, I get caught...
 
 44
 00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,994
 ...you maintain plausible deniability.
 
 45
 00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,835
 Okay, my estranged husband who,
 when he was working...
 
 46
 00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,436
 ...made $43,000 a year,
 starts shovelling money at me.
 
 47
 00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,989
 And when the police come,
 I'm supposed to say:
 
 48
 00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,516
 "I never thought about it, officers.
 Made sense to me". Really?
 
 49
 00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,070
 That, in your mind,
 is plausible deniability?
 
 50
 00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,914
 I tell you what, Walt...
 
 51
 00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,152
 ...I'd rather have them think
 I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...
 
 52
 00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,799
 ...than some complete idiot.
 
 53
 00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,075
 So you're promoting caution here.
 
 54
 00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,309
 And you want a believable story.
 
 55
 00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,598
 That, it seems to me,
 is the safest way...
 
 56
 00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,278
 ...to make the best
 out of a very bad situation, yes.
 
 57
 00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,677
 But I'm noting a little hole
 in your plot though.
 
 58
 00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,669
 Why would your estranged husband
 be doing all this for you?
 
 59
 00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,759
 Because he loves his family and
 desperately wants a reconciliation...
 
 60
 00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,595
 ...though it may be hopeless
 and futile.
 
 61
 00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,958
 Then again, he'd try anything.
 
 62
 00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,596
 I'm just not buying it.
 No, I think it would be better...
 
 63
 00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,911
 ...if the husband
 were no longer estranged.
 
 64
 00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,829
 Yeah. Maybe if he were back
 sleeping in his own bed.
 
 65
 00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,913
 And suddenly a fantasy story.
 
 66
 00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,798
 I am at least gonna be a part
 of this household.
 
 67
 00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,394
 Dinner with the family
 every night of the week.
 
 68
 00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,118
 Not every night, no.
 
 69
 00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,391
 Six nights a week.
 You'll get one night off.
 
 70
 00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,830
 Dinner two nights. Not weekends.
 
 71
 00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,672
 With 24-hours' notice.
 
 72
 00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,671
 Five nights a week, with no notice.
 
 73
 00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,910
 Three. Six-hours' notice.
 
 74
 00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,640
 - Five nights a week, with two hours' notice.
 - Four.
 
 75
 00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,753
 Don't push it.
 
 76
 00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,795
 - And I want my own key to the house.
 - No.
 
 77
 00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,190
 For emergencies and appearances,
 yes.
 
 78
 00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,114
 I am going to babysit my own daughter,
 I'm going to help my son with his homework.
 
 79
 00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,877
 I am going to be a part of this family.
 That is how we'll sell your little fiction.
 
 80
 00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,191
 How about we stop somewhere
 afterward and get a beer?
 
 81
 00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,075
 No. Thanks, though.
 Maybe some other time.
 
 82
 00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,431
 Seriously.
 
 83
 00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,796
 Hit a beer with me.
 
 84
 00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,638
 What?
 
 85
 00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,356
 What the hell are you doing?
 
 86
 00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,670
 That's ours, right?
 
 87
 00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,152
 Look at it and tell me if that's ours.
 
 88
 00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,678
 Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.
 
 89
 00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,109
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 
 90
 00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,272
 Where did you get that?
 Did you take it from the lab?
 
 91
 00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,558
 I bought it from the two guys
 who killed Combo.
 
 92
 00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
 They had Combo shot down
 in the street...
 
 93
 00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,596
 ...and now it's our product
 they're selling.
 
 94
 00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,955
 Which means they work for our guy.
 Right?
 
 95
 00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,556
 What? No. What is that?
 That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?
 
 96
 00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,952
 I heard it from the sister
 of the kid who shot him.
 
 97
 00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,514
 Hear how I just said "kid"?
 
 98
 00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,550
 This kid, he's 11 years old.
 
 99
 00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,632
 Shot Combo on orders.
 
 100
 00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,232
 These two scumbags,
 they got him dealing.
 
 101
 00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,072
 They got him...
 
 102
 00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,071
 And you know he's not the first.
 
 103
 00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,675
 They use kids because hey, why not?
 Easy to control. Easy to fool.
 
 104
 00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,070
 All they get is juvie
 if they get caught.
 
 105
 00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,595
 Hearts and minds, right?
 
 106
 00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,514
 Get them young
 and they're yours forever.
 
 107
 00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,157
 These guys killed Combo.
 
 108
 00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,552
 They used this little kid
 like some puppet.
 
 109
 00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,830
 They used him to shoot my friend.
 
 110
 00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,038
 So why are you telling me this?
 
 111
 00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,836
 I need your help.
 
 112
 00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,755
 How?
 
 113
 00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,117
 - I need ricin.
 - Oh, my God.
 
 114
 00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,355
 - Oh, my God.
 - Look, these two...
 
 115
 00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,555
 - Hey.
 - No.
 
 116
 00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,508
 Hey, they gotta go. All right?
 I got the... entire thing figured out.
 
 117
 00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,636
 - No.
 - The delivery method, everything.
 
 118
 00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,997
 All I need from you is the poison,
 that's all.
 
 119
 00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,355
 - No...
 - Look.
 
 120
 00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,200
 - Otherwise, you don't have to lift a finger.
 - No.
 
 121
 00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,555
 You don't even know
 what you're talking about.
 
 122
 00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,632
 - Not even...
 - Look, you don't get how right this is?
 
 123
 00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,874
 You don't get how the whole
 entire world would be better off?
 
 124
 00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,553
 No. We're not even talking about this.
 
 125
 00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,235
 I know a woman who buys
 from these two once or twice a week.
 
 126
 00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,791
 Alright? She brings them hamburgers
 'cause they sit in their car all day and they
 get hungry, so she brings them food...
 
 127
 00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,235
 ...and they knock a few bucks
 off her price.
 
 128
 00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,960
 There's your delivery system
 right there.
 
 129
 00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,315
 - I could be a mile away.
 - Jesus.
 
 130
 00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,040
 A meth-head
 you're trusting to do this?
 
 131
 00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,351
 Know what? That meth-head stood up
 to your brother-in-law.
 
 132
 00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,035
 He questioned her for five hours.
 She didn't give it up.
 
 133
 00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,590
 You know how it is? You know it?
 Because you're not in prison right now.
 
 134
 00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,149
 Well, I know I would be in prison
 after this.
 
 135
 00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,357
 Prison or worse.
 And I'd be right alongside you.
 
 136
 00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,239
 No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.
 
 137
 00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,392
 This is a ridiculous idea.
 
 138
 00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,109
 It's ridiculous? What,
 so you're saying it's not gonna work?
 
 139
 00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,470
 How about back when it was your plan?
 Back when we were gonna use it on Tuco?
 
 140
 00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,359
 - Apples and oranges.
 - Guy eats ricin...
 
 141
 00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,957
 ...two or three days later he gets the flu
 or a heart attack or something and he keels over.
 
 142
 00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,396
 That's what you said.
 Untraceable back to us.
 
 143
 00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,755
 To me.
 
 144
 00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,432
 Not even that other scumbag
 we work for is ever gonna figure it out.
 
 145
 00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,798
 It was a good plan back when
 it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.
 
 146
 00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,114
 Tuco wanted to murder us.
 These guys don't.
 
 147
 00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,910
 Apples and oranges. Do I really have
 to sit here and explain the difference to you?
 
 148
 00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,039
 Combo was us, man.
 
 149
 00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,476
 He was one of us.
 Does that mean nothing?
 
 150
 00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,713
 Why didn't you go after these guys
 two or three months ago?
 
 151
 00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,871
 Because I just found out about them.
 
 152
 00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,473
 What's to find out?
 
 153
 00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,312
 It's a dispute over turf, right?
 
 154
 00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,315
 I mean, how hard could it have been for
 you to track them down on their turf...
 
 155
 00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,153
 ...and kill them months ago?
 
 156
 00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,031
 Because back then, you were too busy
 getting high, feeling sorry.
 
 157
 00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,992
 Now, murder is not part
 of your 12-step programme.
 
 158
 00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,391
 This is not some amends
 that you have to make.
 
 159
 00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,030
 What you are talking about here
 is pointless.
 
 160
 00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,630
 This achieves nothing.
 
 161
 00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,951
 It accomplishes nothing.
 
 162
 00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,152
 If you don't see
 what it accomplishes...
 
 163
 00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,233
 ...then there's no way
 I can explain it to you.
 
 164
 00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,229
 Jesse, listen to me.
 
 165
 00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,677
 You are not a murderer.
 
 166
 00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,077
 I'm not, and you're not.
 
 167
 00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,195
 It's as simple as that.
 
 168
 00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,118
 Jesse.
 
 169
 00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,476
 I'm doing it.
 
 170
 00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,997
 With or without you.
 
 171
 00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,113
 Knock, knock.
 
 172
 00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,956
 Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say
 "knock, knock," you... like that.
 
 173
 00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,873
 - I like saying it.
 - Well, that's not the rules.
 
 174
 00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,200
 - Okay?
 - You knock your way, I'll knock mine.
 
 175
 00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,351
 But look, see? I win.
 
 176
 00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,397
 Not so fast.
 
 177
 00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,470
 Christ, again? Three in a row.
 
 178
 00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,076
 Got a fricking Paul Newman
 over here?
 
 179
 00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,471
 - Have you been playing cards with your dad?
 - No. Why?
 
 180
 00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,552
 How is your old man?
 
 181
 00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,914
 Back teaching?
 
 182
 00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,231
 No. I don't think
 either of them are working...
 
 183
 00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,595
 ...right now.
 - How they swinging that?
 
 184
 00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,557
 - I don't know.
 - Hey...
 
 185
 00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,359
 ...did you know that
 the doctors told your Uncle Hank...
 
 186
 00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,750
 ...that he can get out of here
 anytime he wants to?
 
 187
 00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,070
 Oh, yeah? That's great.
 
 188
 00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,676
 - Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
 - Why not?
 
 189
 00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,799
 What? That's what they said.
 
 190
 00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,473
 That's what they said
 because they want the room.
 
 191
 00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,279
 They hit the sheets with Lysol,
 reset the meter...
 
 192
 00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,035
 ...and wheel the next slob in here.
 We went over this, Marie. Drop it.
 
 193
 00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,310
 Are you not well enough?
 
 194
 00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,477
 Jesus, kid, you too?
 Do I look well enough?
 
 195
 00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,279
 I'm shitting in pans,
 peeing in pitchers.
 
 196
 00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,034
 I can't move my legs. Got it?
 
 197
 00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,431
 So people in wheelchairs
 should be in hospitals?
 
 198
 00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,151
 What about people on crutches?
 Maybe I should be in here too.
 
 199
 00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,435
 - Is that what you're trying to say?
 - Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying.
 Deal, you little prick.
 
 200
 00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,158
 Bitch.
 
 201
 00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,874
 You know I'm hourly, right?
 
 202
 00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,711
 He promised me
 that he would be here.
 
 203
 00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,438
 Oh, he promised.
 
 204
 00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,957
 Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
 That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.
 
 205
 00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,830
 - Okay, so, what's plan B?
 - I don't know.
 
 206
 00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,193
 - I really don't.
 - Well, let's brainstorm.
 
 207
 00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,390
 - You really think he's serious?
 - That's why I'm here, Saul.
 
 208
 00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,997
 The way he was talking,
 he is going to do it. Or try, at least.
 
 209
 00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,230
 Okay, so what? We pay him off.
 
 210
 00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,995
 No, no, it's not about money.
 It's about getting him off the streets.
 
 211
 00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
 Getting him to calm down.
 
 212
 00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,792
 Maybe...
 
 213
 00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,031
 What if we, maybe...?
 
 214
 00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,750
 Could you get him arrested?
 
 215
 00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,395
 You want your criminal associate
 taken into police custody?
 
 216
 00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,790
 No, now listen.
 I know it sounds risky.
 
 217
 00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,350
 But it wouldn't anything
 that would get him into real trouble...
 
 218
 00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,239
 ...and nothing that could lead back
 to our business.
 
 219
 00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,913
 Just some minor offence.
 
 220
 00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,833
 Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
 I'm picturing it and...
 
 221
 00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,915
 No, not jail as in "jail" jail.
 
 222
 00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,793
 I'm talking about
 one of those situations...
 
 223
 00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,999
 ...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
 picking up litter along the highway.
 
 224
 00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,317
 That's jail.
 
 225
 00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,670
 You're talking about a level-two joint.
 
 226
 00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
 Something that keeps him off the street
 for, say, 30 days.
 
 227
 00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,358
 Then by the time he gets out...
 
 228
 00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,239
 ...tempers have cooled
 and hopefully we can move on.
 
 229
 00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,154
 Well, Roswell Correctional's
 pretty low impact, you know.
 
 230
 00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,198
 In the past,
 I've recommended Springer...
 
 231
 00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,388
 ...but I'm hearing chancy things about
 their bathrooms since they renovated.
 
 232
 00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,879
 So...
 
 233
 00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,156
 So it's possible, right?
 
 234
 00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,869
 Well, it falls under
 my Premium Services Package...
 
 235
 00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,397
 ...but you can afford that.
 I'll call my PI.
 
 236
 00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,114
 You understand what you have to do?
 
 237
 00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,629
 And you can never talk to anyone,
 right?
 
 238
 00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,675
 I mean, ever. Understand?
 
 239
 00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,432
 Yeah.
 
 240
 00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,753
 I found this stuff on the Internet.
 
 241
 00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,956
 Takes days to kick in.
 
 242
 00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,271
 Just keep quiet
 and this won't ever come back to you.
 
 243
 00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,715
 You okay with this, right?
 
 244
 00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,479
 Just think of it
 like it's the same thing as always.
 
 245
 00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,279
 You're just delivering
 some hamburgers.
 
 246
 00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,798
 It's not just delivering hamburgers.
 
 247
 00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,636
 Hey. You got a kid, right?
 
 248
 00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,792
 - What's his name?
 - Patrick.
 
 249
 00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,034
 All right, imagine these two guys
 had Patrick working as a mule.
 
 250
 00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,037
 Making him kill people.
 
 251
 00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,998
 Wouldn't you do anything
 to protect your kid?
 
 252
 00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,038
 Of course, I would.
 I do all kinds of things for him.
 
 253
 00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,314
 Okay, so...
 
 254
 00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,109
 ...these guys are using kids like that.
 
 255
 00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,996
 They gotta go. Right?
 
 256
 00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,638
 Good.
 
 257
 00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,351
 Tomorrow.
 
 258
 00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,876
 I'll be in touch.
 
 259
 00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,309
 Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?
 
 260
 00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,832
 Hey.
 
 261
 00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,431
 Come here, baby.
 
 262
 00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,478
 Okay. Here we go.
 
 263
 00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,915
 Here we go.
 
 264
 00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,197
 What are you doing?
 If you need to talk, use the phone.
 
 265
 00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,352
 This isn't a phone talk, Walter.
 
 266
 00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,875
 Your wife's out, right?
 
 267
 00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,952
 Isn't she something?
 
 268
 00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,680
 I got a granddaughter
 a few years older.
 
 269
 00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,354
 What can I do for you?
 
 270
 00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,915
 Have a seat, Walter.
 
 271
 00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,191
 I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
 and this plan of yours.
 
 272
 00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,150
 - And?
 - Well, I'm not gonna do it.
 
 273
 00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,357
 - Why?
 - Because it's moronic.
 
 274
 00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,549
 Saul said you've done things
 like this before.
 
 275
 00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,508
 - That's not the moronic part.
 - Okay. So, what's the problem?
 
 276
 00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,592
 The problem is
 the boss wouldn't like it.
 
 277
 00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,595
 Saul?
 
 278
 00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,911
 My boss.
 
 279
 00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,628
 Your boss.
 
 280
 00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,548
 This is a professional courtesy.
 No one knows I'm here. Understand?
 
 281
 00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,917
 But our employer would find out,
 like always.
 
 282
 00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,993
 And if Pinkman were arrested,
 he'd take it as a problem.
 
 283
 00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,718
 Walt...
 
 284
 00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,191
 ...you got a good thing going here.
 We all do.
 
 285
 00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,113
 You wanna risk it all on one junkie?
 
 286
 00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,350
 Now, I realise
 you two have a history...
 
 287
 00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,877
 ...but this kid's been on the bubble
 a while now. It's a long time coming.
 
 288
 00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,558
 What is?
 
 289
 00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,272
 I used to be a beat cop,
 a long time ago.
 
 290
 00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
 And I'd get called out on domestic 
 disputes all the time.
 
 291
 00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,355
 Hundreds, probably, over the years.
 
 292
 00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,559
 But there was this one guy, this one
 piece of shit that I will never forget.
 
 293
 00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,599
 Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.
 You remember him?
 
 294
 00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,558
 - Walking Tall? You don't remember?
 - No.
 
 295
 00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,510
 Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...
 
 296
 00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,719
 ...but his wife...
 Or whatever she was... His lady...
 
 297
 00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,838
 ...was real small. Like a bird.
 
 298
 00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,514
 Wrists like little branches.
 
 299
 00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,996
 Anyway, my partner and I'd
 get called out there... every weekend...
 
 300
 00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,549
 ...and one of us would
 pull her aside and we'd say:
 
 301
 00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,280
 "Come on, tonight's the night
 we press charges."
 
 302
 00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,432
 And this wasn't one of those
 "deep down, he loves me" setups.
 
 303
 00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,717
 We got a lot of those, but not this.
 This girl was scared.
 
 304
 00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,111
 She wasn't gonna cross him.
 No way, no how.
 
 305
 00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,556
 Nothing we could do but pass her
 off to the EMT's, put him a car...
 
 306
 00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,280
 ...drive him downtown,
 throw him in a drunk tank.
 
 307
 00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,273
 He sleeps it off,
 next morning, out he goes.
 
 308
 00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,634
 Back home.
 
 309
 00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,071
 But one night...
 
 310
 00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,271
 ...my partner's out sick,
 and it's just me.
 
 311
 00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,715
 And the call comes in
 and it's the usual crap.
 
 312
 00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,519
 Broke her nose in the shower
 kind of thing.
 
 313
 00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,513
 So I cuff him, put him in the car
 and away we go.
 
 314
 00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,596
 Only that night...
 
 315
 00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,430
 ...we're driving into town...
 
 316
 00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,958
 ...and this sideways asshole is in
 my back seat humming "Danny Boy."
 
 317
 00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,314
 And it just rubbed me wrong.
 
 318
 00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,069
 So instead of left, I go right,
 out into nowhere.
 
 319
 00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,119
 And I kneel him down
 and I put my revolver in his mouth...
 
 320
 00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:24,071
 ...and I told him,
 "This is it. This is how it ends."
 
 321
 00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,238
 And he's crying,
 going to the bathroom all over himself.
 
 322
 00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,709
 Swearing to God
 he's gonna leave her alone.
 
 323
 00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,998
 Screaming, much as you can
 with a gun in your mouth.
 
 324
 00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,875
 And I told him to be quiet.
 
 325
 00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,112
 That I needed to think
 about what I was gonna do here.
 
 326
 00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,909
 And, of course, he got quiet...
 
 327
 00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,036
 ...goes still and real quiet.
 
 328
 00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,189
 Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.
 
 329
 00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,198
 Then we just stood there for a while.
 
 330
 00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,958
 Me, acting like
 I'm thinking things over...
 
 331
 00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,636
 ...and Prince Charming kneeling
 in the dirt with shit in his pants.
 
 332
 00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,588
 And after a few minutes,
 I took the gun out of his mouth...
 
 333
 00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,350
 ...and I say, "So help me,
 if you ever touch her again...
 
 334
 00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,514
 ...I will such and such and such,
 and blah, blah, blah."
 
 335
 00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,238
 Just a warning?
 
 336
 00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,915
 Of course.
 
 337
 00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,792
 Just trying to do the right thing.
 
 338
 00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,158
 But two weeks later he killed her.
 
 339
 00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,595
 Of course.
 
 340
 00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,594
 Caved her head in
 with the base of a Waring blender.
 
 341
 00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,598
 We got there, there was so much blood,
 you could taste the metal.
 
 342
 00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,554
 Moral of the story is...
 
 343
 00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
 ...I chose a half measure...
 
 344
 00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,239
 ...when I should have
 gone all the way.
 
 345
 00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,632
 I'll never make that mistake again.
 
 346
 00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,152
 No more half measures, Walter.
 
 347
 00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,831
 Man, I don't get this.
 
 348
 00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,709
 I don't get this at all.
 All I'm seeing is the kid.
 
 349
 00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,957
 So where are they?
 
 350
 00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,157
 I don't know. They're always around.
 
 351
 00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,108
 Burgers are getting cold.
 
 352
 00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,398
 So is it, like, fast?
 
 353
 00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,039
 Don't sweat it, alright?
 You're just doing what you do.
 
 354
 00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,760
 Hey, nobody's gonna know anything.
 
 355
 00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,113
 - Can I have another bump?
 - Look, you had your bump.
 
 356
 00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,113
 Get this thing done,
 then you can have all you want.
 
 357
 00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,317
 Gonna need you to come with me.
 
 358
 00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,071
 Take a walk.
 
 359
 00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,957
 Where we going?
 
 360
 00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,597
 Sit down.
 
 361
 00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,756
 I understand that you have a problem
 with two of my employees.
 
 362
 00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,636
 It is true that they killed
 one of your associates.
 
 363
 00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,109
 It is possible they acted rashly.
 
 364
 00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,393
 But, on the other hand,
 there was provocation.
 
 365
 00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,835
 The man was selling
 on their territory.
 
 366
 00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,434
 There is blame on both sides.
 
 367
 00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,072
 This will go no further.
 
 368
 00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,472
 It will be settled right here,
 right now.
 
 369
 00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,470
 You told him?
 
 370
 00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,029
 Wait outside.
 
 371
 00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,676
 Listen to me. You have one friend
 in this room. This man.
 
 372
 00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,838
 Those men outside
 are my trusted employees.
 
 373
 00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,232
 And when I learned
 what you intended to do...
 
 374
 00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,429
 If it wasn't for this man
 and the respect I have for him...
 
 375
 00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,956
 ...I would be dealing with this
 in a very different way.
 
 376
 00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,317
 You don't look at him.
 You look at me.
 
 377
 00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,594
 This is what happens now.
 My men will come back inside...
 
 378
 00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,117
 ...and you will shake their hands
 and you will make peace.
 
 379
 00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,748
 And that will be the end of this.
 
 380
 00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,559
 No.
 
 381
 00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,713
 Jesse.
 
 382
 00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,436
 - Pardon me?
 - They use kids.
 
 383
 00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,229
 These assholes of yours got an 11-year-old 
 kid doing their killing for them.
 
 384
 00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,517
 You're supposed to be some kind
 of a reasonable businessman.
 
 385
 00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,716
 This how you do business?
 
 386
 00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,113
 You okay with this?
 You got anything to say here?
 
 387
 00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,397
 Bring them back.
 
 388
 00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,271
 No more children.
 
 389
 00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,392
 Understand?
 
 390
 00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,033
 And you...
 
 391
 00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,076
 ...you keep the peace.
 
 392
 00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,192
 Say it.
 
 393
 00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,790
 Yeah. I'll keep the peace.
 
 394
 00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,393
 Shake hands.
 
 395
 00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,120
 Jesse, your actions...
 
 396
 00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,438
 ...they affect other people.
 
 397
 00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,760
 Sometimes
 compromises have to be made...
 
 398
 00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,800
 ...for the best of reasons.
 
 399
 00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,635
 Jesse. Jesse.
 
 400
 00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,435
 Marie, let the people
 who get paid to do this do this.
 
 401
 00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,558
 The people who get paid to do this
 do a lousy job.
 
 402
 00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,755
 So I guess this is what you want,
 huh?
 
 403
 00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,675
 Just lying in a hospital bed
 getting sponge baths from nurses.
 
 404
 00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,432
 Marie.
 
 405
 00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,353
 It's time to go home, Hank.
 
 406
 00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,069
 How many times I gotta tell you, Marie?
 Not till I'm well.
 
 407
 00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,992
 Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?
 
 408
 00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,513
 I'm just seeing.
 
 409
 00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,229
 - Seeing what?
 - Seeing what I see.
 
 410
 00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,069
 - I'm not at my best here, Marie.
 - We'll see.
 
 411
 00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,511
 Nothing's gonna happen.
 
 412
 00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,869
 I say it will.
 
 413
 00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,749
 No. I'm in this bed for a reason.
 
 414
 00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,351
 It's a waste of time.
 
 415
 00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,390
 Besides, what if someone comes in?
 
 416
 00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,757
 - I don't care if someone walks in.
 - Marie, what's wrong with you?
 
 417
 00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,628
 I'll tell you what. If I can get
 the groundhog to see his shadow...
 
 418
 00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,279
 Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.
 
 419
 00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,638
 I'm betting it will.
 And if he does, you check out of here.
 
 420
 00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,113
 I'm not gonna bet
 on whether I can get a boner.
 
 421
 00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,352
 - It's no bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
 - You afraid you'll lose?
 
 422
 00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,069
 You know, you're just...
 You're just being foolish, you know?
 
 423
 00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,073
 Come on. What's the point?
 
 424
 00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,710
 The point is
 you're not completely hopeless.
 
 425
 00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,231
 We have a bet?
 
 426
 00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,673
 You know what?
 
 427
 00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,877
 If it'll get you out of here quicker.
 You got one minute.
 
 428
 00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,029
 - One minute?
 - Yeah.
 
 429
 00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,838
 All right. That's a cakewalk.
 
 430
 00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,797
 You know, this is just...
 
 431
 00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,837
 This is just sad. I mean...
 
 432
 00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,835
 I really feel sorry for you,
 Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...
 
 433
 00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,469
 - It's pathetic.
 - That's good, keep talking.
 
 434
 00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,712
 Protest. Struggle.
 
 435
 00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,833
 Marie, give up.
 I mean, seriously, it's...
 
 436
 00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,153
 ...not...
 
 437
 00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,149
 ...gonna happen.
 
 438
 00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,152
 Bad day?
 
 439
 00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,829
 I don't even know.
 
 440
 00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,758
 Anyway...
 
 441
 00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,235
 ...it's better now.
 
 442
 00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,996
 Tell them you're busy.
 
 443
 00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,112
 Hello?
 
 444
 00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,478
 Grandma?
 
 445
 00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,552
 Slow down.
 
 446
 00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,991
 Slow down, I can't...
 
 447
 00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,318
 Oh, God.
 
 448
 00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,110
 Oh, God.
 
 449
 00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,431
 Oh, God.
 
 450
 00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,037
 Tomás!
 
 451
 00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,352
 No.
 
 452
 00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,830
 You have to let me in. Please.
 
 453
 00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,718
 Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
 
 454
 00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,518
 Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.
 
 455
 00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,355
 I'm starting without you.
 
 456
 00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,710
 - What is "wasabi"?
 - Wasabi. Right you are.
 
 457
 00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,199
 Four-letter word for 1200.
 
 458
 00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,399
 Pilots and musicians
 know this word derives from...
 
 459
 00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,357
 Dinner's almost ready, okay?
 
 460
 00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,158
 Okay.
 
 461
 00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,118
 - What is "solo"? 
 - That's the word.
 - This guy's good.
 
 462
 00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,508
 Four letter word, 2000.
 
 463
 00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,912
 "A loud, harsh cry;
 Walt Whitman's was barbaric."
 
 464
 00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,991
 - "Yell."
 - What is "yawp"?
 
 465
 00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,354
 - Kevin.
 - What is "yawp"?
 
 466
 00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,397
 - Yawp.
 - Tokyo, 1200.
 
 467
 00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,396
 - This crustacean...
 - What the heck's a yawp?
 
 468
 00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,633
 A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.
 
 469
 00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,234
 That's what I said.
 
 470
 00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,277
 Okay to use your bathroom, right?
 
 471
 00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,949
 Yeah, okay.
 
 472
 00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,512
 Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
 
 473
 00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,157
 Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
 
 474
 00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,029
 Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
 apology because I did not rat you out.
 
 475
 00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,397
 I was looking out for
 your best interests, as well as my own.
 
 476
 00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,676
 And I stand by my decision
 100 percent...
 
 477
 00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,549
 ...so we'll just have to agree
 to disagree.
 
 478
 00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,237
 Anyway, just call me back.
 
 479
 00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,875
 - So the TV turns itself off, huh?
 - Yeah.
 
 480
 00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,553
 I'll get it.
 
 481
 00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,633
 - The beginning of an early cold snap.
 But first, more details on...
 
 482
 00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,233
 Where's the remote?
 
 483
 00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,994
 The murder of a young boy
 in the South Valley.
 
 484
 00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,276
 Police have yet
 to release a statement...
 
 485
 00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,477
 ...but sources indicate
 that 11-year-old Tomás Cantillo...
 
 486
 00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,552
 ...may have been the victim
 of a gang-related execution.
 
 487
 00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,314
 An anonymous tip brought police
 to a playground...
 
 488
 00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,392
 ...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue
 late last night.
 
 489
 00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,314
 Paramedics were called to the scene
 but were unable to revive the boy.
 
 490
 00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,199
 - A gruesome crime...
 - Can you turn that off?
 
 491
 00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,669
 Yet another casualty
 in what appears to be...
 
 492
 00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,910
 ...the city's ongoing struggle...
 - Walt?
 
 493
 00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,629
 ...against drugs and the gangs
 that peddle them. We'll be passing...
 
 494
 00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,551
 Hand me your dad...
 
 495
 00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,511
 I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
 about that all day, and it's just...
 
 496
 00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,557
 No. Yeah.
 
 497
 00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,313
 Hey, did you know your Dad and I...
 
 498
 00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,278
 ...are thinking about maybe
 starting a business together?
 
 499
 00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,351
 Seriously?
 
 500
 00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,154
 What kind of business?
 
 501
 00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,311
 We're thinking maybe a car wash.
 
 502
 00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,471
 What do you mean? Like the...?
 
 503
 00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,149
 I'm sorry, I have to go.
 
 504
 00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,675
 Oh, my God.
 
 505
 00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,955
 Run.
