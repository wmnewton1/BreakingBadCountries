 â€‹1
 00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,717
 Surprised he doesn't
 make us do that.
 
 2
 00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,470
 The pack totally has a pecking order.
 
 3
 00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,235
 And the head hyena,
 he's the man, you know.
 
 4
 00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,834
 All the other ones have to,
 like, kiss his ass.
 
 5
 00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,036
 I mean, literally. It's so gross.
 
 6
 00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,272
 They have to lick his junk.
 
 7
 00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,796
 I can't believe
 they even showed it on TV.
 
 8
 00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,510
 Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
 like, major-league and all...
 
 9
 00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,310
 ...we should have... equipment
 maintainer guys.
 
 10
 00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,630
 And water boys, you know?
 
 11
 00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,357
 Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.
 
 12
 00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,037
 Get us a couple flunkies in here.
 
 13
 00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,078
 Treat us right.
 
 14
 00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,953
 Okay, 15 hours starts now.
 
 15
 00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,350
 I'm gonna hit it,
 if that's cool with you.
 
 16
 00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,114
 - I don't understand.
 - What?
 
 17
 00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,316
 These numbers,
 they just don't add up.
 
 18
 00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,630
 Told you. Dude's totally boning us.
 
 19
 00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,360
 No, it's not that.
 
 20
 00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,196
 It's our output. We're off.
 We're.14 percent off.
 
 21
 00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,433
 Point one-four. That's, what, like...?
 
 22
 00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,999
 What does that mean?
 
 23
 00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,709
 It means we should be netting
 more than we're netting.
 
 24
 00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,312
 So how far off are we?
 
 25
 00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,789
 It's not negligible.
 
 26
 00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,154
 Ball-parking at it, I'd say
 we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.
 
 27
 00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,949
 That's weird.
 
 28
 00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,953
 Well, what about spillage?
 
 29
 00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,115
 Spillage?
 
 30
 00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,350
 You know, when,
 like, just stuff gets spilled.
 
 31
 00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,398
 Nothing gets spilled.
 
 32
 00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,754
 A little maybe.
 
 33
 00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,478
 Nothing gets spilled.
 
 34
 00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,837
 What about evaporation?
 
 35
 00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,155
 It wouldn't account for this much.
 The materials aren't out that long.
 
 36
 00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,038
 What about the other one?
 
 37
 00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,919
 The drops, like on...
 
 38
 00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,958
 Like on, like, cold beer.
 
 39
 00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,475
 - Condensation?
 - Yeah.
 
 40
 00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,159
 No.
 
 41
 00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,233
 Well, what about the crap
 that gets left behind?
 
 42
 00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,198
 You know, all the gunk
 we scrape out of the vats.
 
 43
 00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,591
 Gotta add up to like a gallon each.
 
 44
 00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,876
 Did you work that in?
 
 45
 00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,756
 - Vestiges.
 - Yeah. Vestiges.
 
 46
 00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,318
 Bet that's it.
 
 47
 00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,755
 Bet that's totally it.
 
 48
 00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,593
 Hey, Mr. White.
 
 49
 00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,077
 Mr. White.
 
 50
 00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,432
 Are you okay?
 
 51
 00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,151
 Yeah. Yeah, why?
 
 52
 00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,238
 Nothing.
 
 53
 00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,114
 Are you coming?
 
 54
 00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,836
 Yeah, in a minute.
 
 55
 00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,311
 All right, see you tomorrow.
 
 56
 00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,117
 All right.
 
 57
 00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,431
 Shit.
 
 58
 00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,038
 Bastard.
 
 59
 00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,356
 Son of a...
 
 60
 00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,318
 Come on, you...
 
 61
 00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,232
 Come on, come on.
 
 62
 00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,551
 Son of a...
 
 63
 00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,755
 Come on.
 
 64
 00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,470
 Son of a bitch.
 
 65
 00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,638
 That's great.
 
 66
 00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,358
 All right.
 
 67
 00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,956
 You little bastard.
 
 68
 00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,109
 Shut the door!
 
 69
 00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,114
 - My ears are popping.
 - Shut the door. Move.
 
 70
 00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,919
 Feels like on an airplane.
 What the hell's doing that?
 
 71
 00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,196
 Positive pressure.
 
 72
 00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,993
 Positive what?
 
 73
 00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,434
 God, it frigging kills, yo.
 
 74
 00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,194
 - Well, just move your jaw around.
 - I am moving it around.
 
 75
 00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,396
 - It's not working.
 - Just yawn or something.
 
 76
 00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,238
 Stop acting like such a baby.
 
 77
 00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,399
 Damn.
 
 78
 00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,835
 What positive? Positive what?
 
 79
 00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,074
 Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
 to keep the outside out.
 
 80
 00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,357
 There's been a contamination.
 
 81
 00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,750
 Wait. What?
 
 82
 00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,751
 Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.
 
 83
 00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,797
 Something got into the lab.
 
 84
 00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,394
 So, what do we do?
 
 85
 00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,675
 I mean, do we...?
 
 86
 00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,354
 Wait. Wait. I mean,
 shouldn't we be wearing masks?
 
 87
 00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,115
 No, no, it's not that kind
 of contaminant.
 
 88
 00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
 So it's, like, not dangerous?
 
 89
 00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,833
 Mr. White, talk to me here.
 
 90
 00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,075
 Not to us particularly, no.
 
 91
 00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,668
 What the hell is that?
 
 92
 00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,310
 This is...
 
 93
 00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,152
 I made it.
 
 94
 00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,593
 So exactly what kind of contaminant
 are we dealing with here?
 
 95
 00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,318
 A fly.
 
 96
 00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,593
 What do you mean?
 
 97
 00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,274
 A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?
 
 98
 00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,069
 I mean, a fly. A housefly.
 
 99
 00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,471
 Like one fly?
 
 100
 00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,194
 Singular?
 
 101
 00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,038
 - What did it do?
 - It got into the lab.
 
 102
 00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,270
 I'm trying to get it out.
 Okay? Understand?
 
 103
 00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,552
 No, man, not really. I can't say that
 I'm really following you here.
 
 104
 00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
 Dude, you scared the shit out of me!
 
 105
 00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,151
 When you say it's contamination,
 I mean...
 
 106
 00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,515
 ...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
 or something.
 
 107
 00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,715
 Ebola.
 
 108
 00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,348
 Yeah, it's a disease
 on The Discovery Channel...
 
 109
 00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,478
 ...where all your intestines sort of
 just slip out of your butt.
 
 110
 00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,074
 Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
 Now, tell me.
 
 111
 00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,870
 What would a West African virus
 be doing in our lab?
 
 112
 00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,231
 So you're chasing around a fly
 and in your world, I'm the idiot.
 
 113
 00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,518
 Jesse, listen.
 
 114
 00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,719
 This fly...
 No, any fly cannot be in our lab.
 
 115
 00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,916
 It's a problem. It's a contamination.
 
 116
 00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,356
 And that is in no way a misuse
 of the word. Okay?
 
 117
 00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,277
 So in terms of keeping our cook clean
 and our product unadulterated...
 
 118
 00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,715
 ...we need to take this very seriously.
 
 119
 00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,518
 Now do you understand?
 
 120
 00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,591
 So is that your fly-sabre?
 
 121
 00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,319
 This is a swatter.
 
 122
 00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,074
 And it happens to work quite well,
 thank you.
 
 123
 00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,437
 Hey, what happened to your head?
 
 124
 00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,033
 Nothing. I'm fine.
 
 125
 00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,112
 You didn't hit it,
 like really, really hard?
 
 126
 00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,398
 My head is not the problem, Jesse.
 The fly is the problem.
 
 127
 00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,868
 You didn't happen to maybe try
 our product, did you?
 
 128
 00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,555
 Jesse, I know this seems unusual
 to you, a layman.
 
 129
 00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,152
 A fly. I get it.
 It seems insignificant, right?
 
 130
 00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,393
 But trust me, in a highly controlled
 environment such as this...
 
 131
 00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,113
 ...any pollutant...
 
 132
 00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,955
 ...no matter how small...
 
 133
 00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,595
 ...could completely...
 
 134
 00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,989
 Hello?
 
 135
 00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,708
 What?
 
 136
 00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,678
 Were you here all night?
 
 137
 00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,518
 Have you even slept?
 
 138
 00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,114
 No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?
 
 139
 00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,475
 Will you just please focus on...?
 
 140
 00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,198
 Okay, look, we're running late,
 so let's just get started.
 
 141
 00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,396
 The sooner we do it,
 the sooner we're done.
 
 142
 00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,199
 Fricking finally.
 
 143
 00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,399
 What are you doing?
 
 144
 00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,551
 It's time to alkaline.
 
 145
 00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,757
 Have you not heard a word I said?
 
 146
 00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,037
 No cooking until this fly
 is dealt with.
 
 147
 00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,395
 Have I been speaking to myself?
 
 148
 00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,755
 The timer went off, yo.
 
 149
 00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,912
 How long is this batch gonna be
 good for? An hour? Two?
 
 150
 00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,755
 The batch will be good for nothing
 if we don't clear the contaminant.
 
 151
 00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,876
 "Clear the contaminant."
 
 152
 00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,508
 We're making meth here, all right?
 Not space shuttles.
 
 153
 00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,195
 We're making nothing until
 we catch this fly.
 
 154
 00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,475
 What fly? All right?
 
 155
 00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,189
 Where the hell is this fly?
 Not like I even seen the thing.
 
 156
 00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,591
 Maybe your positive pressure blew it
 out the door or something.
 
 157
 00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
 No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?
 
 158
 00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,191
 He's around, and I am not going
 to expose this batch...
 
 159
 00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,510
 ...to the open air and contamination,
 period.
 
 160
 00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,036
 Now, you can leave me to deal with
 this myself or you can help me.
 
 161
 00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,270
 But you are right.
 We're running out of time.
 
 162
 00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,954
 So I need your answer right now.
 
 163
 00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,993
 Okay.
 
 164
 00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,438
 Hey, tick-tock, yo.
 
 165
 00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,316
 Look, I like making cherry product,
 but let's keep it real, all right?
 
 166
 00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,473
 We make poison for people
 who don't care.
 
 167
 00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,313
 We probably have the most un-picky
 customers in the world.
 
 168
 00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,994
 No, no, no. No rationalizing.
 
 169
 00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,118
 We'll find it any minute.
 Don't give up.
 
 170
 00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,073
 Did you know that there's
 an acceptable level of rat turds...
 
 171
 00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,277
 ...that can go into candy bars?
 
 172
 00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,639
 That's the government, Jack.
 
 173
 00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,148
 Even the government doesn't care
 that much about quality.
 
 174
 00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,068
 You know what is okay to put
 in hotdogs, huh?
 
 175
 00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,993
 Pig lips and assholes.
 
 176
 00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,235
 But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
 because I love hotdogs.
 
 177
 00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,234
 - And, you know, see what I'm try...?
 - What are you doing?
 
 178
 00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,119
 Oh, hey.
 
 179
 00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,318
 Look, let me just top it off,
 all right, really quick.
 
 180
 00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,948
 You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
 shut the lid.
 
 181
 00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,588
 No harm done. Then we're golden.
 
 182
 00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,590
 It stays closed. That's an order.
 
 183
 00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,830
 You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
 We're 50-50 partners, remember?
 
 184
 00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,871
 God, what is your problem?
 
 185
 00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,438
 Freaking psycho.
 
 186
 00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,876
 - Jesse.
 - Oh, God.
 
 187
 00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,759
 - It, like, hit bone.
 - Jesse.
 
 188
 00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,478
 Jesse.
 
 189
 00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,676
 You see it, right?
 
 190
 00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,118
 You see it?
 
 191
 00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,838
 Yeah.
 
 192
 00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,832
 Get it.
 
 193
 00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,312
 You want me to get it?
 
 194
 00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,159
 Yes.
 
 195
 00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,552
 Slow. Move slowly.
 
 196
 00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,678
 I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.
 
 197
 00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,071
 Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
 your swatter thing.
 
 198
 00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,593
 Come on.
 
 199
 00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,634
 Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.
 
 200
 00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,392
 Yeah.
 
 201
 00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,878
 - Yeah, come on.
 - Just make it count.
 
 202
 00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,794
 Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
 I'm gonna make it count, all right.
 
 203
 00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,635
 Okay. Now, on three.
 
 204
 00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,153
 Okay.
 
 205
 00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,429
 One...
 
 206
 00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,878
 Motherfuck...!
 
 207
 00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,272
 Yeah. You like that, huh?
 Hurts, huh?
 
 208
 00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,800
 - Did you get it?
 - I think so, yeah.
 
 209
 00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,394
 - Where is it?
 - I don't know. What does it matter?
 
 210
 00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,357
 Who cares? I got it.
 
 211
 00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,751
 - Oh, Jesus, seriously?
 - Where is it?
 
 212
 00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,676
 It's right there. Look.
 
 213
 00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,799
 Look. See? I told you I got it.
 
 214
 00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,475
 This is a raisin.
 
 215
 00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,550
 Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...
 
 216
 00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,277
 Oh, man.
 
 217
 00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,439
 He's got some skills, yo.
 
 218
 00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,079
 I'll give him that.
 
 219
 00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,152
 Look.
 
 220
 00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,032
 I feel like I'm running out of ways
 to explain this to you...
 
 221
 00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,351
 ...but once more, I shall try.
 
 222
 00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,316
 This fly is a major problem for us.
 
 223
 00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,119
 It will ruin our batch.
 
 224
 00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,751
 And we need to destroy it
 and every trace of it so we can cook.
 
 225
 00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,911
 Failing that...
 
 226
 00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,077
 ...we're dead.
 
 227
 00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,079
 There is no more room for error.
 
 228
 00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,955
 Not with these people.
 
 229
 00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,999
 All right, how about we go
 get some air?
 
 230
 00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,913
 "Get some air"?
 
 231
 00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,389
 Your answer to,
 "We're sliding headfirst...
 
 232
 00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,949
 ...into a massive crap..."
 - Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.
 
 233
 00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,237
 All right, I understand that the fly
 is a serious thing now.
 
 234
 00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,549
 All right? I'm on board.
 
 235
 00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,757
 I'm just saying, you know,
 maybe if we went and got some air...
 
 236
 00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,515
 ...it would help us come up with a plan
 on how to catch it.
 
 237
 00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,229
 Then come back down here
 and subtract his ass.
 
 238
 00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,679
 - Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
 - Yeah.
 
 239
 00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,593
 You sure? Last thing we need
 is to get locked out.
 
 240
 00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,593
 Yeah. Hey!
 
 241
 00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,354
 If you're not gonna help me,
 stay out of my way!
 
 242
 00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,953
 Hey!
 
 243
 00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,797
 Yo, yo, does somebody have
 an axe I can use?
 
 244
 00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,680
 There we go.
 
 245
 00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,116
 Say good night.
 
 246
 00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,515
 Son of a bitch!
 
 247
 00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,991
 Son of a...
 
 248
 00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,992
 Damn it.
 
 249
 00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,316
 Where in the hell is that...?
 
 250
 00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,672
 What the hell?
 
 251
 00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,154
 Need some juice maybe?
 
 252
 00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,671
 Knock yourself out.
 
 253
 00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,034
 It's a real one.
 
 254
 00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,077
 Yeah, like yours was working.
 
 255
 00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,277
 No, no, no.
 
 256
 00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,351
 Look, we're trying to decontaminate.
 
 257
 00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
 You don't decontaminate by
 contaminating further.
 
 258
 00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,276
 What the hell is all this?
 
 259
 00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,274
 Here, how about this?
 
 260
 00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,671
 "Non-toxic glue strips."
 
 261
 00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,991
 Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
 all right? I got a butt-Ioad.
 
 262
 00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,470
 We hang them up all over the place.
 It won't be able to resist.
 
 263
 00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,077
 I sure hope we have... enough.
 
 264
 00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,349
 I'm gonna go out on a limb
 and say yeah.
 
 265
 00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,678
 Do you see him?
 
 266
 00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,034
 How long do you think
 you've been awake?
 
 267
 00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,918
 Why do you keep asking me that?
 
 268
 00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,471
 Just figure, you know, you could use
 some coffee, is all. I know I could.
 
 269
 00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,437
 How about it?
 
 270
 00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,719
 Yeah.
 
 271
 00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,913
 - You take cream and sugar?
 - Black is fine.
 
 272
 00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,669
 Why don't you just leave him be?
 
 273
 00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,990
 Let the traps do the work.
 
 274
 00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,188
 These pheromones are supposed
 to kick ass.
 
 275
 00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,033
 Bet we catch this mofo any second.
 
 276
 00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,039
 Thank you.
 
 277
 00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,830
 You ever have, like, a wild animal
 trapped in your house?
 
 278
 00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,192
 Not that I can recall, no.
 
 279
 00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,354
 We did, this one time,
 back when it was my aunt's house...
 
 280
 00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,478
 ...back before she died of cancer.
 
 281
 00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,596
 It was a possum.
 Big freaky-Iooking bitch.
 
 282
 00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,638
 Hey, since when did they change it
 to "opossum"?
 
 283
 00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,713
 What's up with that? I mean, when
 I was coming up, it was just "possum."
 
 284
 00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,236
 You know, "opossum" makes it sound
 like he's Irish or something.
 
 285
 00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,790
 I mean, why they gotta go
 changing everything?
 
 286
 00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,269
 Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.
 
 287
 00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,228
 Giant pink-tailed rats
 with their pink rat faces.
 
 288
 00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,076
 Totally freaky, like alien rats.
 
 289
 00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,957
 Actually, it's not so much
 that he got trapped...
 
 290
 00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,113
 ...but he was living there,
 you know, under the house.
 
 291
 00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,317
 You could hear him going from,
 like, room to room...
 
 292
 00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,392
 ...always scurrying around.
 
 293
 00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,588
 Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
 and it would just, you know, freeze.
 
 294
 00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,991
 I mean, it's like you're not looking
 right at it, right?
 
 295
 00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,913
 I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.
 
 296
 00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,436
 That's what they do.
 I mean, they play dead or whatever.
 
 297
 00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,160
 It's just so lame.
 
 298
 00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,472
 Is there a discernible point
 to this story?
 
 299
 00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,359
 A point that you'll be arriving at
 sometime in the near future?
 
 300
 00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,555
 It was just a total bitch to get out.
 You know, it took forever.
 
 301
 00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,068
 Guy came, set all these traps and all
 and he finally got it.
 
 302
 00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,711
 But my aunt, you know,
 she didn't believe it.
 
 303
 00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,832
 I mean, she kept insisting
 she could still hear the thing.
 
 304
 00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,719
 I mean, you could not tell her
 any different.
 
 305
 00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,873
 She started keeping an old umbrella,
 you know, by her chair.
 
 306
 00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,998
 Man, she would just bang on the floor
 and yell at it.
 
 307
 00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,435
 Even gave it a name.
 
 308
 00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,195
 It was Scrabble.
 
 309
 00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,588
 Yeah, that was it.
 
 310
 00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,389
 You know,
 "Scrabble, just knock it off:"
 
 311
 00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,628
 She got like that toward the... end.
 
 312
 00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,875
 Got obsessive about stuff.
 Just got mad about stuff.
 
 313
 00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,435
 We didn't know what was up.
 
 314
 00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,158
 It wasn't like her to be that way.
 
 315
 00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,393
 But it turned out that the cancer
 had spread to her brain...
 
 316
 00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,790
 ...and that was why.
 
 317
 00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,355
 It metastasised.
 
 318
 00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,831
 But it was good that that was when
 we decided to take her to the doctor...
 
 319
 00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,230
 ...because then we knew
 what was up.
 
 320
 00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,150
 You know, got her some treatment.
 
 321
 00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,990
 Meds, so she wasn't stressing
 all the time.
 
 322
 00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,189
 It was a lot better after that.
 
 323
 00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,956
 You know, she was a lot happier.
 
 324
 00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,356
 Where the hell is he?
 
 325
 00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,877
 I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...
 
 326
 00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,792
 ...just last week.
 
 327
 00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,309
 I'm still in remission.
 
 328
 00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,992
 I'm healthy.
 
 329
 00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,836
 Okay, so good. Great.
 
 330
 00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,835
 Well...
 
 331
 00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,075
 ...no end in sight.
 
 332
 00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,235
 That's great.
 
 333
 00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,992
 Well...
 
 334
 00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,517
 ...I missed it.
 
 335
 00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,438
 There was some perfect moment
 and it passed me right by.
 
 336
 00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,711
 I had to have... enough to leave them.
 
 337
 00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,075
 That was the whole point.
 
 338
 00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,474
 I mean, none of this...
 
 339
 00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,196
 None of this makes any sense
 if I didn't have... enough.
 
 340
 00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,712
 But it had to be
 before she found out. Skyler.
 
 341
 00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,269
 It had to be before that.
 
 342
 00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,877
 Perfect moment for what?
 
 343
 00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,116
 To drop dead?
 
 344
 00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,395
 What, you saying you wanna die?
 
 345
 00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,317
 I'm saying I've lived too long.
 
 346
 00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
 I mean...
 
 347
 00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,672
 ...you want them to actually miss you,
 you know?
 
 348
 00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,917
 You want their memories of you
 to be...
 
 349
 00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,471
 But she just won't...
 
 350
 00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,518
 She just won't understand.
 
 351
 00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,196
 I mean, no matter how well
 I explain it...
 
 352
 00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,272
 ...these days, she just has this...
 
 353
 00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,953
 This...
 
 354
 00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,920
 I mean, I truly believe there... exists
 some combination of words.
 
 355
 00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,552
 There must exist certain words
 in a certain specific order...
 
 356
 00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,840
 ...that would explain all of this,
 but with her, I just...
 
 357
 00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,793
 I just can't ever seem to find them.
 
 358
 00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,076
 Mr. White,
 how about you just sit down?
 
 359
 00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,993
 You know, I was thinking maybe
 before the fugue state...
 
 360
 00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,357
 ...but before the fugue state,
 I didn't have... enough money.
 
 361
 00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,876
 So no, not then.
 
 362
 00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,553
 And plus,
 my daughter wasn't born yet.
 
 363
 00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,874
 It had to be after Holly was born.
 
 364
 00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,632
 Mr. White...
 
 365
 00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,473
 Definitely before the surgery.
 
 366
 00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,230
 Oh, Christ.
 
 367
 00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,636
 That damn second cell phone.
 
 368
 00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,268
 I mean, how could I possibly...?
 
 369
 00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,670
 I know the moment.
 
 370
 00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,353
 It was the night Jane died.
 
 371
 00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,470
 Yeah, I...
 
 372
 00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,436
 I was at home
 and we needed diapers...
 
 373
 00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,151
 ...and so I said I'd go,
 but it was just an excuse.
 
 374
 00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,598
 Actually, that was the night
 I brought you your money, remember?
 
 375
 00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,718
 Yeah, I remember.
 
 376
 00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,755
 But afterward, I stopped at a bar.
 
 377
 00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,956
 It was odd.
 I never do that, go to a bar alone.
 
 378
 00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,669
 I just walked in, sat down.
 
 379
 00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,956
 I never told you.
 
 380
 00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,756
 That you went to a bar?
 
 381
 00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,193
 No, I...
 
 382
 00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,035
 I sit down and this man,
 this stranger...
 
 383
 00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,395
 ...he... engages me in conversation.
 
 384
 00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,471
 He's a complete stranger.
 
 385
 00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,833
 But he turns out to be Jane's father,
 Donald Margolis.
 
 386
 00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,752
 What are you talking about?
 
 387
 00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,514
 Of course, I didn't know it
 at the time.
 
 388
 00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,478
 I mean, he was just some guy
 in a bar.
 
 389
 00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,679
 I didn't put it together until after the
 crash when he was all over the news.
 
 390
 00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,751
 Jane's dad.
 
 391
 00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,639
 I mean, think of the odds.
 
 392
 00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,269
 Once I tried to calculate them,
 but they're astronomical.
 
 393
 00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,991
 I mean, think of the odds of me
 going in, sitting down...
 
 394
 00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,153
 ...that night in that bar
 next to that man.
 
 395
 00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,636
 What did you talk about?
 
 396
 00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,555
 Water on Mars.
 
 397
 00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,432
 Family.
 
 398
 00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,312
 What about family?
 
 399
 00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,999
 I told him that I had a daughter
 and he told me he had one too.
 
 400
 00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,278
 Then he said:
 
 401
 00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,750
 "Never give up on family."
 
 402
 00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,351
 And I didn't.
 
 403
 00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,230
 I took his advice.
 
 404
 00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,872
 The universe is random.
 It's not inevitable.
 
 405
 00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,998
 It's simple chaos.
 
 406
 00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,711
 It's subatomic particles
 in endless aimless collision.
 
 407
 00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,553
 That's what science teaches us.
 
 408
 00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,390
 But what is this saying?
 
 409
 00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,752
 What is it telling us when, on the very
 night that this man's daughter dies...
 
 410
 00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,591
 ...it's me who's having a drink
 with him?
 
 411
 00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,799
 I mean, how can that be random?
 
 412
 00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,680
 Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.
 
 413
 00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,957
 No, no. No, it's...
 
 414
 00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,718
 No. No.
 
 415
 00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,951
 No, that was the moment.
 
 416
 00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,151
 That night.
 
 417
 00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,713
 I should never have left home.
 
 418
 00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,754
 Never gone to your house.
 
 419
 00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,277
 Maybe things would have...
 
 420
 00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,070
 Oh, thought I was...
 
 421
 00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,753
 I was at home watching TV.
 
 422
 00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,392
 It was some...
 
 423
 00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,751
 Some nature programme
 about elephants.
 
 424
 00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,956
 And Skyler and Holly
 were in another room.
 
 425
 00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,511
 I could hear them
 on the baby monitor.
 
 426
 00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,273
 She was singing a lullaby.
 
 427
 00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,910
 If I had just lived right up
 to that moment...
 
 428
 00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,119
 ...and not one second more...
 
 429
 00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
 ...that would have been perfect.
 
 430
 00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,634
 He's not coming down.
 
 431
 00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,917
 Must be Thailand-hot up there.
 
 432
 00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,151
 That's why he likes it.
 
 433
 00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,749
 Thailand's hot, right?
 
 434
 00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,355
 Yeah.
 
 435
 00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,114
 Then that's why.
 
 436
 00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,277
 - Oh, Jesus.
 - Hey, hey, wait. Here.
 
 437
 00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,394
 He's not coming down.
 
 438
 00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,555
 He's staying up there forever.
 
 439
 00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,875
 What are you...? What are you doing?
 
 440
 00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,555
 What do you think?
 I'm gonna get that bitch.
 
 441
 00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,200
 No, you're gonna break your neck.
 
 442
 00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,635
 Yeah, yeah. Just...
 
 443
 00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,836
 No, seriously, you're...
 This is a bad idea.
 
 444
 00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,791
 Damn it.
 
 445
 00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,473
 Jesse.
 
 446
 00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,755
 Just hold onto it.
 
 447
 00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,071
 Hold it still?
 
 448
 00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,991
 Jesse.
 
 449
 00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,833
 I'm sorry.
 
 450
 00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,709
 Sorry for what, being a lunatic?
 
 451
 00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,394
 I'm sorry about Jane.
 
 452
 00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,112
 Yeah.
 
 453
 00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,797
 Me too.
 
 454
 00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,392
 I mean...
 
 455
 00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,193
 ...I'm very sorry.
 
 456
 00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,955
 It's not your fault.
 
 457
 00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,632
 It's not mine... either.
 
 458
 00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,873
 It's no one's fault, not even hers.
 
 459
 00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,394
 You know, we are who we are,
 Mr. White.
 
 460
 00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,839
 You know, two junkies
 with a duffel bag full of cash.
 
 461
 00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,631
 Like you said, we both would've
 been dead within a week.
 
 462
 00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,316
 But I miss her, though.
 
 463
 00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,236
 God, I do.
 
 464
 00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,034
 Jesse.
 
 465
 00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,352
 Come down.
 
 466
 00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,751
 Wait. I'm so close.
 
 467
 00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,196
 Let it go.
 
 468
 00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,519
 We need to cook.
 
 469
 00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,271
 What about the contamination?
 
 470
 00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,274
 It's all contaminated.
 
 471
 00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,590
 All right, well...
 
 472
 00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,396
 ...I definitely scared him.
 
 473
 00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,076
 Probably stay out of our way.
 
 474
 00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,713
 Yeah!
 
 475
 00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,275
 Somebody got got, yo!
 
 476
 00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,510
 Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?
 
 477
 00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,671
 Bins are packed?
 
 478
 00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,191
 Bins are packed.
 
 479
 00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,273
 How's the yield?
 
 480
 00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,749
 Two-oh-two and change.
 
 481
 00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,278
 You okay getting home?
 
 482
 00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,750
 Yeah. Better. Thanks.
 
 483
 00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,751
 MaÃ±ana, then.
 
 484
 00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,638
 Jesse, come here.
 
 485
 00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,676
 I couldn't chance saying it inside.
 
 486
 00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,435
 For all I know,
 the lab's wired for sound.
 
 487
 00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,315
 That half a pound
 I said we were off by.
 
 488
 00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,910
 Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...
 
 489
 00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,759
 You understand?
 And if they ever found out...
 
 490
 00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,828
 I didn't take shit.
 
 491
 00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,030
 I'm just saying that
 I won't be able to protect you.
 
 492
 00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,514
 Who's asking you to?
