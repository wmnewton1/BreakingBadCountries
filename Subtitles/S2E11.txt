 1
 00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,359
 -What's up?
 -How's it going?
 
 2
 00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,515
 All right.
 
 3
 00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,879
 What you need?
 
 4
 00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,236
 You buying
 or you just stopping to envy?
 
 5
 00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,716
 Yeah. Punk bitches.
 
 6
 00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,679
 Please leave your message
 for 505-127-5223.
 
 7
 00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,713
 Record your message after the tone.
 To send a numeric pageâ€”8
 00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,989
 Bounce, little man.
 
 9
 00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,556
 Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
 getting eyeballed hard.
 
 10
 00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,910
 I got a bad feeling, man.
 I need some backup.
 
 11
 00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,315
 Get your ass up here now.
 
 12
 00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,837
 -What's that thing in your ear?
 -What did I say? Get out of here!
 
 13
 00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,910
 What are you waiting for? Go!
 
 14
 00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,630
 Well, Walt, we've made such headway
 with your treatments...
 
 15
 00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,912
 ...that now it's time we talked about
 sealing the deal.
 
 16
 00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,314
 Absolutely.
 
 17
 00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,839
 As you know...
 
 18
 00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,918
 ...my initial diagnosis was
 that your cancer was inoperable.
 
 19
 00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,717
 That may no longer be the case.
 
 20
 00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,232
 We think now that a lobectomy
 may be a viable option.
 
 21
 00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,158
 Maybe a pretty good option.
 
 22
 00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
 Dr. Bravenec is one of
 the few surgeons in the country...
 
 23
 00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,588
 ...performing lobectomies
 after full-dosage radiation.
 
 24
 00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,030
 He's got a good track record.
 
 25
 00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,753
 Pretty good.
 
 26
 00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,396
 It sounds...
 
 27
 00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,709
 ...aggressive.
 
 28
 00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,953
 Yes. Very much so.
 
 29
 00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,833
 Understand that
 if you don't have this surgery...
 
 30
 00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,235
 ...you're just waiting
 for the cancer to spread.
 
 31
 00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,476
 And it will.
 
 32
 00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,192
 Through the treatment you've had,
 we've bought you some time.
 
 33
 00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,358
 Maybe a lot, probably a little...
 
 34
 00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,918
 ...but that's all.
 
 35
 00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,838
 In my opinion...
 
 36
 00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,235
 ...if you're willing to take some risk...
 
 37
 00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,476
 ...then this offers the best chance.
 
 38
 00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,639
 How much would it cost?
 I mean, I'm not on your insurance.
 
 39
 00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,513
 I'd say between 170-...
 
 40
 00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,029
 ...and 200,000, all in.
 
 41
 00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,676
 For my part, I'd be willing
 to write off what I can...
 
 42
 00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,553
 ...but mine isn't even
 the biggest expense.
 
 43
 00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,996
 This is obviously a big decision...
 
 44
 00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,351
 ...and you folks are gonna wanna
 take some time to discuss it.
 
 45
 00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,679
 No.
 
 46
 00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,038
 I'll do it.
 
 47
 00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,590
 Walt, don't you think we should
 at least talk this through first?
 
 48
 00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,713
 I just think it's the way to go.
 
 49
 00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,792
 I have to say,
 I think it's the right choice.
 
 50
 00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,955
 I recommend
 that we let the pneumonitis heal...
 
 51
 00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,878
 ...for another couple of weeks...
 
 52
 00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,275
 ...and then we'll have at it.
 
 53
 00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,596
 That's tricky.
 
 54
 00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,590
 -When's the due date?
 -It's the 21 st.
 
 55
 00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,074
 So two weeks and change?
 
 56
 00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,396
 I'll book the surgery
 for four weeks from now.
 
 57
 00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,592
 That way Walter can be on his feet
 for the birth of your daughter.
 
 58
 00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,997
 But I wouldn't wait any longer.
 
 59
 00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,873
 Yeah.
 
 60
 00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,754
 Fourteen messages....
 
 61
 00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,757
 God.
 
 62
 00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,113
 -Yeah.
 -It's me.
 
 63
 00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,596
 Where the hell were you?
 I called, like, 20 times.
 
 64
 00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,119
 Working.
 
 65
 00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,594
 What is it?
 
 66
 00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,158
 Combo's dead.
 
 67
 00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,273
 Shot.
 
 68
 00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,989
 Which one is he?
 
 69
 00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,713
 You did not just say that to me.
 
 70
 00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,275
 -Jesse, listen--
 -That figures.
 
 71
 00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,993
 What's the word on the street?
 
 72
 00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,716
 No one's dropping no names.
 
 73
 00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,957
 Combo rang me before it went down,
 said dudes were mad-dogging him...
 
 74
 00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,789
 ...trying to run him up off the corner.
 That's all I know.
 
 75
 00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,078
 Why'd we have to go pushing
 into new turf, yo? I mean...
 
 76
 00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,998
 ...what'd you expect?
 
 77
 00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,434
 I don't know.
 
 78
 00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,232
 You don't know?
 
 79
 00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,152
 Is that all you got?
 
 80
 00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,033
 I'll do right by Combo's people.
 
 81
 00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,237
 But make sure you bust up your cell
 and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.
 
 82
 00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,914
 I appreciate what
 you're saying and all...
 
 83
 00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,352
 ...but with Combo gone
 and Badger laying low out in Cali....
 
 84
 00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,719
 I'm on probation, man.
 
 85
 00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,673
 Fast track to Los Lunas.
 
 86
 00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,117
 We're on the verge...
 
 87
 00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,359
 ...of making some serious coin,
 Skinny.
 
 88
 00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,915
 What, you're gonna jump ship now?
 
 89
 00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,514
 This game we playing? We don't got
 the street cred to survive it.
 
 90
 00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,355
 Back when everyone thought
 you killed Spooge...
 
 91
 00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,313
 ...maybe we were doing okay,
 but that whole...
 
 92
 00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,673
 -...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
 -Yeah?
 
 93
 00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,552
 His junkie bitch copped to it.
 
 94
 00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,595
 Whole town knows it wasn't you.
 
 95
 00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,833
 Everyone knows?
 
 96
 00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,435
 -Why didn't you say something?
 -I don't know, man.
 
 97
 00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,039
 Because we like you and all.
 
 98
 00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,232
 I'm telling you, just sit tight.
 
 99
 00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,308
 We'll get by.
 
 100
 00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,149
 -All right? We'll make it.
 -Sorry, Jesse.
 
 101
 00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,399
 I'm out.
 
 102
 00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,711
 We have had a bit of a setback.
 
 103
 00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,750
 That's an accurate description.
 What else do you want me to call it?
 
 104
 00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,633
 -How about "your fault"?
 -No, no, don't lay that on me.
 
 105
 00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,877
 -You are in charge of distribution.
 -You said expand the territory.
 
 106
 00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,389
 -Doesn't mean you become careless.
 -Guys, guys! Hey!
 
 107
 00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,353
 Do I look like Maury Povich?
 I'm not your marriage counsellor.
 
 108
 00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,074
 Now, you're professionals.
 Act like it.
 
 109
 00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,236
 Now, setback. Go.
 
 110
 00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,357
 One of our dealers was murdered.
 
 111
 00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,279
 It was some kind of turf dispute...
 
 112
 00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,516
 ...and apparently we lost.
 
 113
 00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,359
 And then everyone quit on us.
 
 114
 00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,269
 I mean,
 we have absolutely no distribution.
 
 115
 00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,835
 Is there any way any of this
 can be traced back to you?
 
 116
 00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,996
 Now, the police, I'm talking about.
 
 117
 00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,552
 Well, there's your silver lining.
 
 118
 00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,433
 How about you?
 How's the health situation?
 
 119
 00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,791
 It's better. Do you mind?
 
 120
 00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,399
 Better?
 
 121
 00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,637
 Yeah, it's...
 
 122
 00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,639
 ...looking a little more positive.
 
 123
 00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,512
 I may have more time than I thought.
 
 124
 00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,472
 Outstanding.
 
 125
 00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,875
 Now, as to your dead guy:
 
 126
 00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,798
 occupational hazard.
 
 127
 00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,194
 Drug dealer getting shot?
 
 128
 00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,279
 I'm gonna go out on a limb here
 and say it's been known to happen.
 
 129
 00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,438
 Now, what about product on hand?
 How's your inventory?
 
 130
 00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,631
 Thirty-eight and change.
 
 131
 00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,637
 Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?
 
 132
 00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,989
 Pounds.
 
 133
 00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,228
 You did say make hay
 while the sun is shining.
 
 134
 00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,431
 Guys!
 
 135
 00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,437
 Why the long faces here?
 
 136
 00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,676
 You're sitting on a gold mine.
 
 137
 00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,871
 A gold mine we can't sell.
 
 138
 00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,275
 We need a proper infrastructure.
 
 139
 00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,710
 We need foot soldiers
 and we need dealers...
 
 140
 00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,672
 ...on a street level
 that are rock solid.
 
 141
 00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,838
 We need muscle
 and we need enforcers.
 
 142
 00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,917
 Payback. That's what we need.
 
 143
 00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,319
 God.
 
 144
 00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,236
 I mean, this entire process
 has just been so....
 
 145
 00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,991
 It's always been one step forward
 and two steps back.
 
 146
 00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,591
 We need your help.
 
 147
 00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,714
 Look, let's start with
 some tough love, all right?
 
 148
 00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,512
 Ready for this? Here goes.
 
 149
 00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,474
 You two suck at peddling meth.
 Period.
 
 150
 00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,035
 So give up on trying
 to do it all yourselves.
 
 151
 00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,549
 Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.
 
 152
 00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,992
 Look, we are not going to deal with
 another high-level distributor.
 
 153
 00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,316
 No, thank you.
 We have been down that road.
 
 154
 00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,034
 What, some tattooed speed freak?
 
 155
 00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,516
 No. What you two need
 is an honest-to-God businessman.
 
 156
 00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,438
 Somebody who treats your product...
 
 157
 00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,871
 ...like the simple
 high-margin commodity that it is.
 
 158
 00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,152
 Somebody who ships out of town,
 deals only in bulk.
 
 159
 00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,512
 Someone who's been doing this
 for 20 years and never been caught.
 
 160
 00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,192
 You know someone like that?
 
 161
 00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,188
 Let's just say I know a guy
 who knows a guy.
 
 162
 00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,197
 Who knows another guy.
 
 163
 00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,075
 Let me make some calls,
 see if I can get you a meeting.
 
 164
 00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,951
 Well, what's his name?
 
 165
 00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,639
 I have no idea.
 
 166
 00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,109
 He's very low profile.
 He's careful like that.
 
 167
 00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,310
 You know,
 from what I do hear about him...
 
 168
 00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,431
 ...he sounds a little like you.
 
 169
 00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,919
 And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.
 
 170
 00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,588
 He's coming to the end
 and he's got the big fist pump.
 
 171
 00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,712
 Now Mueller's coming.
 Oh, a double! Here he comes.
 
 172
 00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,310
 And he's coming to the end
 and he takes second.
 
 173
 00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,476
 I need you to leave.
 
 174
 00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,996
 Look, there's...
 
 175
 00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,918
 ...some stuff about me
 you don't know and....
 
 176
 00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,233
 Like you're a drug dealer?
 
 177
 00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,439
 I kind of got that.
 
 178
 00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,554
 You pay in cash
 and you use an alias, so....
 
 179
 00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,955
 One of my guys...
 
 180
 00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,399
 ...a friend who worked for me...
 
 181
 00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,674
 ...got murdered.
 
 182
 00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,630
 It was my fault.
 I put him on that corner.
 
 183
 00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,314
 I'm gonna smoke some crystal
 and I just think you should go...
 
 184
 00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,399
 ...being that you're in a programme
 and all and....
 
 185
 00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,237
 You could come with me
 to a meeting.
 
 186
 00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,713
 No.
 
 187
 00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,319
 No meetings.
 
 188
 00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,589
 We could just get out of here.
 
 189
 00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,998
 -It won't help.
 -Yeah, it will.
 
 190
 00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,555
 And I don't need you
 telling me that it won't.
 
 191
 00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,239
 I just....
 
 192
 00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,035
 All right, I really just need you to go.
 
 193
 00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,797
 Sir? Enjoy your meal.
 
 194
 00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,513
 Thank you.
 
 195
 00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,112
 You're late.
 
 196
 00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,788
 Yeah.
 
 197
 00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,673
 We're in the big time now.
 
 198
 00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,476
 So where's the kingpin?
 
 199
 00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,754
 Your guess is as good as mine.
 
 200
 00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,668
 So you get the dude's name?
 
 201
 00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,439
 Nope.
 
 202
 00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,757
 So let me get this straight.
 He's allowed to know all our names...
 
 203
 00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,918
 ...what we look like,
 but not the other way around?
 
 204
 00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,275
 Why don't you get yourself
 some food?
 
 205
 00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,630
 So we won't both sit here
 with our Happy Meals...
 
 206
 00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,432
 ...looking like a couple chumps?
 
 207
 00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,313
 Gentlemen,
 is everything to your satisfaction?
 
 208
 00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,994
 Fine, thanks.
 
 209
 00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,993
 This is nothing but an ankle-grab.
 
 210
 00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,198
 I don't get you, man.
 
 211
 00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,029
 A week ago you talked like
 you were all ready to hang it up.
 
 212
 00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,397
 We've nearly got 40 pounds
 we still need to sell.
 
 213
 00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,272
 Yeah, what about after?
 
 214
 00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,711
 After you gonna make up
 some new magic number?
 
 215
 00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,275
 Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
 I gotta make more."
 
 216
 00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,516
 What do you want me to say, Jesse?
 
 217
 00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,157
 -Things have changed.
 -Oh, I know.
 
 218
 00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,678
 We got a guy killed.
 
 219
 00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,792
 You know what?
 
 220
 00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,394
 This is bullshit.
 
 221
 00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,316
 -I'm out of here.
 -Hey.
 
 222
 00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,792
 I think she's waking up from a nap.
 
 223
 00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,276
 She is certainly gonna wanna get out
 and stretch those legs soon.
 
 224
 00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,232
 We have to keep an eye
 on your fluids.
 
 225
 00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,032
 You're on the low side of normal.
 
 226
 00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,708
 What? How low?
 
 227
 00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,912
 It's not a problem unless we see
 a growth drop-off, so we're good.
 
 228
 00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,476
 We'll have you in for an ultrasound
 next week and keep an eye on things.
 
 229
 00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,313
 Hey.
 
 230
 00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,556
 Oh, man,
 you would not believe the traffic.
 
 231
 00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,637
 That's why I left 40 minutes early.
 
 232
 00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,751
 -Sorry. Hi.
 -Hi.
 
 233
 00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,269
 -What did I miss?
 -For your refrigerator.
 
 234
 00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,479
 Oh, my God.
 
 235
 00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,829
 Look at her.
 
 236
 00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,393
 -Look.
 -Yeah.
 
 237
 00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,114
 God. It's like she's here already.
 
 238
 00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,756
 I was just telling Skyler
 everything looks great.
 
 239
 00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,076
 Okay, we've been talking
 about it for months now.
 
 240
 00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,111
 It's time to make a decision.
 
 241
 00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,312
 -You know what I'm gonna say.
 -The C-section?
 
 242
 00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,670
 And if it's a yes,
 we need to schedule it.
 
 243
 00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,557
 Well, my last labour
 was pretty tough, so....
 
 244
 00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,560
 For the baby, I say yes.
 
 245
 00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,399
 I agree, considering that your fluids
 are on the low side.
 
 246
 00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,718
 It's best we take her a little early.
 So why don't we schedule it for...
 
 247
 00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
 ...a week from Friday?
 
 248
 00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,798
 Isn't that a Friday the 13th?
 
 249
 00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,072
 We have a birthday.
 
 250
 00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,039
 The 16th.
 
 251
 00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,276
 -I like it.
 -Yeah.
 
 252
 00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,630
 You know, speaking of birthdays...
 
 253
 00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,230
 ...I've got to run back to the office,
 so I will see you later?
 
 254
 00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,113
 It's an hour before closing.
 
 255
 00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,276
 You're supposed to be
 taking it easy.
 
 256
 00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,596
 We're having a get-together
 for Ted's birthday...
 
 257
 00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,358
 ...and I've gotta pick up the cake.
 
 258
 00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,034
 Why you?
 
 259
 00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,555
 Because I said I would...?
 
 260
 00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,228
 It is the least I can do.
 
 261
 00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,235
 -Okay?
 -Yeah, okay. Yeah.
 
 262
 00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,759
 -Bye.
 -Bye.
 
 263
 00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,278
 Let's get out of here.
 
 264
 00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,596
 You know, go do something.
 
 265
 00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,758
 Seriously.
 
 266
 00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,231
 You know that museum in Santa Fe
 you talked about?
 
 267
 00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,677
 Let's take a drive.
 
 268
 00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,073
 Sure.
 
 269
 00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,673
 No, I cannot return that stock.
 It's been drilled, it's been cut.
 
 270
 00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,711
 We're halfway through the job.
 
 271
 00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,592
 Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
 Mr. Beneke to the shop.
 
 272
 00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,233
 All right.
 Just let me think about it, okay?
 
 273
 00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,634
 I gotta go.
 
 274
 00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,751
 Dean, I gotta go.
 
 275
 00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,030
 Okay, all right.
 
 276
 00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,639
 Happy birthday!
 
 277
 00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,708
 Happy birthday!
 
 278
 00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,992
 Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
 Thank you very much.
 
 279
 00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,794
 Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
 hold out much longer.
 
 280
 00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,478
 Wait a minute. You making a wish?
 You gotta make a wish.
 
 281
 00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,389
 Okay. Well, let's see.
 The economy's in the toilet.
 
 282
 00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,672
 China's undercutting us at every turn.
 I'm at a loss.
 
 283
 00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,314
 -Wait. Skyler?
 -Yes?
 
 284
 00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,033
 I wanna hear it first.
 
 285
 00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,399
 Absolutely not. No way.
 
 286
 00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,750
 You cannot deny your employer
 his birthday wish.
 
 287
 00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,599
 -Yes, I can. Watch me.
 -Please!
 
 288
 00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,429
 If this is your birthday wish,
 I feel very, very sorry for you.
 
 289
 00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,950
 -Come on. It was so good last time.
 -It was ages ago.
 
 290
 00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,913
 And I'm enormous now.
 
 291
 00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,236
 And I don't look anything
 like her anymore.
 
 292
 00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,635
 Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.
 
 293
 00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,149
 These candles are getting wax
 all over the place.
 
 294
 00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,032
 -Seriously.
 -Yes, come on, Skyler.
 
 295
 00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,756
 -Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....
 -It's obscene.
 
 296
 00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,793
 Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....
 
 297
 00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,834
 Happy birthday to you
 
 298
 00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,393
 Happy birthday to you
 
 299
 00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,830
 Happy birthday, Mr. President
 
 300
 00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,158
 Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated
 
 301
 00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,553
 Happy birthday
 
 302
 00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,032
 To you
 
 303
 00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,472
 That was fantastic.
 
 304
 00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,432
 Isn't she great, huh?
 
 305
 00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,912
 Okay, here we go.
 
 306
 00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,034
 -He wasn't there.
 -Oh, he was there, all right.
 
 307
 00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,674
 What are you talking about?
 I sat there for two hours.
 
 308
 00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,949
 Nobody came.
 
 309
 00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,674
 All I know is my contact
 said he was there.
 
 310
 00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,030
 Are you sure you were
 at the right restaurant?
 
 311
 00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,992
 Yes, I'm positive.
 
 312
 00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,633
 -Where was he?
 -Who knows?
 
 313
 00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,400
 Maybe he checked you out
 with a telephoto lens...
 
 314
 00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,318
 ...didn't like the cut of your jib.
 
 315
 00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,718
 Anyway, it doesn't matter now
 because my contact says it's a no-go.
 
 316
 00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,272
 What? What do you mean?
 
 317
 00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,799
 No deal. No dice.
 
 318
 00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,877
 Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.
 
 319
 00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,275
 Wait a minute.
 
 320
 00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,869
 How can he make that decision
 without even meeting me?
 
 321
 00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,072
 I told you, he's very cautious
 who he does business with, all right?
 
 322
 00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,555
 He's skittish, like a deer.
 
 323
 00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,679
 Call him back.
 
 324
 00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,836
 I'm sorry. I can't do that.
 
 325
 00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,554
 Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.
 
 326
 00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,910
 First of all,
 I never called him, all right?
 
 327
 00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,270
 I called a guy who called a guy
 who called a guy.
 
 328
 00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,072
 Second of all, it's over.
 
 329
 00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,635
 Understand?
 With this particular individual...
 
 330
 00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,115
 ...all you get is the one shot.
 
 331
 00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,469
 Look...
 
 332
 00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,194
 ...I'll see if I can scrape
 something else together...
 
 333
 00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,072
 ...but don't get your hopes up.
 
 334
 00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,919
 No one else handles
 that kind of bulk.
 
 335
 00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,599
 Damn it.
 
 336
 00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,872
 Lucy, you must remember to have
 the salt and pepper shakers wiped.
 
 337
 00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,592
 Can I help you, sir?
 
 338
 00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,550
 Diet Coke, please.
 
 339
 00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,313
 And five minutes of your time.
 
 340
 00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,034
 -What can I do for you?
 -Have a seat.
 
 341
 00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,239
 Please.
 
 342
 00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,319
 I would like to know why you wouldn't
 meet with me yesterday.
 
 343
 00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,234
 I'm sorry. I'm not following.
 
 344
 00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,789
 I sat here yesterday,
 waiting to meet with someone.
 
 345
 00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,875
 I believe that person was you.
 
 346
 00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,471
 I think that you're confusing me
 for someone else.
 
 347
 00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,113
 I don't think I am.
 
 348
 00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,832
 Sir, if you have a complaint...
 
 349
 00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,190
 ...I suggest you submit it
 through our e-mail system.
 
 350
 00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,755
 I would be happy to refer you
 to our website.
 
 351
 00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,038
 I was told that the man
 I would be meeting with...
 
 352
 00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,435
 ...is very careful.
 
 353
 00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,551
 A cautious man.
 
 354
 00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,114
 I believe we're alike in that way.
 
 355
 00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,635
 If you are who I think you are...
 
 356
 00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,151
 ...you should give me another chance.
 
 357
 00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,759
 I don't think we're alike at all,
 Mr. White.
 
 358
 00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,193
 You are not a cautious man at all.
 
 359
 00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,278
 Your partner was late
 and he was high.
 
 360
 00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,039
 Yes. Yes, he was.
 
 361
 00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,872
 He's high often, isn't he?
 
 362
 00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,038
 You have poor judgement.
 
 363
 00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,356
 I can't work with someone
 with poor judgement.
 
 364
 00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,552
 Are you familiar with my product?
 
 365
 00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,596
 -I've been told it's excellent.
 -It is impeccable.
 
 366
 00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,153
 It is the purest...
 
 367
 00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,670
 ...most chemically sound product
 on the market anywhere.
 
 368
 00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,110
 That is not the only factor.
 
 369
 00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,108
 You could charge twice the current rate
 for what I provide...
 
 370
 00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,675
 ...and your customers would pay it.
 
 371
 00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,872
 Hands down.
 
 372
 00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,755
 Now, who I choose to do business with
 on my end is not your problem.
 
 373
 00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,868
 You won't see him.
 
 374
 00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,719
 You won't interact with him.
 
 375
 00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,838
 Forget he exists.
 
 376
 00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,515
 I have to ask.
 
 377
 00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,235
 Why?
 
 378
 00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,158
 Why him?
 
 379
 00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,159
 Because he does what I say.
 
 380
 00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,869
 Because I can trust him.
 
 381
 00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,476
 How much product
 do you have on hand?
 
 382
 00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,037
 Thirty-eight pounds.
 
 383
 00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,754
 Ready to go at a moment's notice.
 
 384
 00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,512
 Will I hear from you?
 
 385
 00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,399
 I have your numbers.
 
 386
 00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,228
 You can never trust a drug addict.
 
 387
 00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,234
 Look, I mean, it's all kind of
 little dribs and drabs...
 
 388
 00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,477
 ...but right here,
 take Keller, for instance.
 
 389
 00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,070
 A couple hundred dollars here,
 a few thousand there.
 
 390
 00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,759
 Dribs and drabs.
 
 391
 00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,951
 Once you add it all up, though,
 with Keller...
 
 392
 00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,470
 ...the revenues are almost 10 percent
 less than was actually received.
 
 393
 00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,549
 And this is every quarter
 for the last two years.
 
 394
 00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,955
 When I saw that, I got worried
 so I checked Accounts Receivable.
 
 395
 00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,038
 I found six other instances...
 
 396
 00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,594
 ...of revenues being under-reported.
 
 397
 00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,154
 And I've only just started
 to look into it.
 
 398
 00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,591
 We have requirement contracts
 with a lot of these companies.
 
 399
 00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,950
 They anticipate their needs
 for the next quarter.
 
 400
 00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,957
 Most of the time, they overestimate.
 
 401
 00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,469
 I let them roll their overages
 into the next order...
 
 402
 00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,716
 ...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.
 
 403
 00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,478
 Obviously, we forgot...
 
 404
 00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,514
 ...or didn't go back
 and adjust the revenue entries.
 
 405
 00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,837
 I know it's wrong from an accounting
 standpoint, but as you can see...
 
 406
 00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,510
 ...the money's coming in eventually,
 as you can see.
 
 407
 00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,879
 Right.
 
 408
 00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,599
 Right...
 
 409
 00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,237
 ...but I got the old bills of sale
 and order forms out of storage...
 
 410
 00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,715
 ...to try and sort this out.
 
 411
 00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,679
 Most of the time, there's no backup
 for the reported revenues at all.
 
 412
 00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,031
 In a few cases...
 
 413
 00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,517
 ...I found xeroxed copies
 with the dates changed.
 
 414
 00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,078
 Ted.
 
 415
 00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,398
 All right.
 
 416
 00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,638
 You got me.
 
 417
 00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,836
 We're talking nearly a million dollars
 of undocumented revenue.
 
 418
 00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,272
 -What are you thinking?
 -I'm thinking...
 
 419
 00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,550
 ...about saving a company.
 
 420
 00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,478
 I'm thinking about people's jobs...
 
 421
 00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,398
 ...about their mortgages
 and pensions...
 
 422
 00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,751
 ...and their college funds
 for their kids.
 
 423
 00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,709
 Not to mention my own.
 
 424
 00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,388
 It doesn't mean that you have to
 break the law.
 
 425
 00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,192
 Yes, it does, Skyler.
 
 426
 00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,231
 It's in the books.
 Business is terrible.
 
 427
 00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,591
 The bank is on my back,
 the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.
 
 428
 00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,199
 -If I don't keep up--
 -Ted.
 
 429
 00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,119
 People go to prison for this.
 
 430
 00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,838
 My dad built this company
 from nothing.
 
 431
 00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,035
 We make things here.
 
 432
 00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,152
 The people who work here
 are like family.
 
 433
 00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,275
 I can't let that all fall apart
 because of a couple of bad years.
 
 434
 00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,709
 Sky...
 
 435
 00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,311
 ...don't report this.
 
 436
 00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,793
 Please.
 
 437
 00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,474
 I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.
 
 438
 00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,475
 But I can't be a part of it.
 
 439
 00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,833
 I know.
 
 440
 00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,590
 I know. I just wish....
 
 441
 00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,318
 I'm sorry.
 
 442
 00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,112
 I don't want you to go.
 
 443
 00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,078
 Yo, if I know you, leave a message.
 
 444
 00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,919
 Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
 Just checking in with you, man.
 
 445
 00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,872
 We missed you at the funeral today.
 
 446
 00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,479
 The whole crew was representing.
 
 447
 00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,557
 Even Badger came
 all the way from Fresno.
 
 448
 00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,751
 Combo's people, his ma,
 grandma, cousins...
 
 449
 00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,837
 ...everyone was all choked up
 and shit.
 
 450
 00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,600
 Man, it was, like, emotional.
 
 451
 00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,677
 And you should have
 seen the coffin.
 
 452
 00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,677
 It was this shiny white pearlescent.
 
 453
 00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,838
 I'm sure I've seen
 the exact same paint job on a Lexus.
 
 454
 00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,873
 So we're definitely talking high-end.
 
 455
 00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,152
 Anyway, guess you had something
 bigger going down.
 
 456
 00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,318
 Watch your back out there, bro.
 Peace.
 
 457
 00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,957
 I like to mix some ice with it.
 
 458
 00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,112
 Hold that.
 
 459
 00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,799
 What's it feel like?
 
 460
 00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,038
 There's a chill.
 
 461
 00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,350
 Don't freak out. It passes.
 
 462
 00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,028
 And then....
 
 463
 00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,309
 You'll see.
 
 464
 00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,472
 I'll meet you there.
 
 465
 00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,318
 Take that off.
 
 466
 00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,075
 Phones off, please.
 
 467
 00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,396
 Pipes, I guess.
 
 468
 00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,273
 All right, everyone.
 Eyes on your paper.
 
 469
 00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,831
 Eyes on your paper.
 
 470
 00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,594
 Yes.
 
 471
 00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,833
 Excuse me, where's the manager?
 
 472
 00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,235
 I'm the manager. Can I help you?
 
 473
 00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,716
 No, no, no.
 I met a man here last week.
 
 474
 00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,673
 He's a black gentleman.
 He's thin. Glasses.
 
 475
 00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,359
 Yes, sir. That's the owner.
 
 476
 00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,312
 Oh, owner. Okay.
 
 477
 00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,159
 He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
 in between here and Nevada.
 
 478
 00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,555
 He could be at any one of them.
 
 479
 00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,116
 Is there a phone number
 that I can get to...?
 
 480
 00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,914
 I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.
 
 481
 00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,078
 Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
 to refer you to our website.
 
 482
 00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,032
 No, no.
 
 483
 00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,117
 -What's his name?
 -Gustavo.
 
 484
 00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,753
 Gus.
 
 485
 00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,915
 Thank you.
 
 486
 00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,349
 Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.
 
 487
 00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,870
 Truck stop,
 two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.
 
 488
 00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,354
 -One hour.
 -What?
 
 489
 00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,879
 One hour. You in or out?
 
 490
 00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,517
 In. In. Absolutely.
 But I just need a little more time.
 
 491
 00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,631
 One hour. If you miss it...
 
 492
 00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,434
 ...don't ever show your face
 in here again.
 
 493
 00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,913
 Exit 13 off the 25 South,
 to a truck....
 
 494
 00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,112
 -Come on! Come on!
 -Yo, if I know you, leave a message.
 
 495
 00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,993
 Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.
 
 496
 00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,952
 Pick up the phone.
 
 497
 00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,353
 I'm coming by. I need the product.
 
 498
 00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,278
 I need the product now.
 
 499
 00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,115
 Oh, God.
 
 500
 00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,519
 Jesse.
 
 501
 00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,358
 Jesse!
 
 502
 00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,518
 Jesse.
 
 503
 00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,958
 Jesse.
 
 504
 00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,634
 Jesse. Jesse.
 
 505
 00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,478
 Jesse.
 
 506
 00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,470
 Jesse.
 
 507
 00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,193
 Jesse. Jesse, wake up.
 
 508
 00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,992
 Jesse.
 
 509
 00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,188
 Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.
 
 510
 00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,469
 Wake up!
 
 511
 00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,193
 Come on, damn it.

 00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,628
 Wake up.
 
 513
 00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,915
 Where'd you put it?
 
 514
 00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,792
 -Where's the product?
 -Get off of me.
 
 515
 00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,753
 Where is it?
 Where'd you hide the meth?
 
 516
 00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,632
 -In the kitchen.
 -Where?
 
 517
 00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,351
 Under the sink.
 
 518
 00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,995
 No. No, no, no.
 Not now, not now. Not now!
